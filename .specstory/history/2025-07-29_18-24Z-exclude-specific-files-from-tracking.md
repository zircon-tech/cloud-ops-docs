I'll help you prevent these two files from being tracked by git. I need to add them to the `.gitignore` file so they won't be tracked on GitHub.

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: .gitignore</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

Now I'll add the two files to the `.gitignore` file:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="search_replace">

<details><summary>Tool use: **code_edit** • Edit file: .gitignore</summary>

Perfect! I've added both `mith-answers.md` and `suku-answers.md` to the `.gitignore` file. Now these files will not be tracked by git and won't be committed to GitHub.

The files are now listed under a new section "Answer files that shouldn't be tracked" in your `.gitignore` file. Git will ignore these files from now on, so they won't appear in your git status or be accidentally committed to the repository.

is gitignore tracked?

_**Agent (model claude-4-sonnet, mode Agent)**_

Yes, `.gitignore` is tracked by git! This is intentional and how it should be.

Here's how it works:

1. **`.gitignore` is tracked** - The `.gitignore` file itself is committed to the repository and shared with all team members
2. **Files listed IN `.gitignore` are NOT tracked** - The files mentioned inside `.gitignore` (like `mith-answers.md` and `suku-answers.md`) are ignored by git

This is the standard behavior because:
- Everyone on the team needs to know which files should be ignored
- The ignore rules need to be consistent across all developers
- `.gitignore` helps prevent accidentally committing sensitive or temporary files

So when you commit and push your changes, the updated `.gitignore` file will be shared with your team, but the `mith-answers.md` and `suku-answers.md` files will remain local and won't be tracked or uploaded to GitHub.
