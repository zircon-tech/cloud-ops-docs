# Change Management

## Overview

ZirconTech's Change Management framework provides systematic processes to document, manage, and respond to requests for changes to project scope in AWS cloud operations engagements. This comprehensive approach ensures controlled scope modifications while maintaining project quality, timeline integrity, and stakeholder alignment.

Our change management practices are integrated with our contractual framework through the Independent Contractor Consulting Agreement (ICCA) and Work Order structure, providing both flexibility and governance for scope adjustments throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## Change Management Framework

### Contractual Foundation

**Legal Framework Integration:**
ZirconTech's change management processes are built upon our established contractual framework, specifically addressing scope changes as outlined in Section 4 of our standard Work Orders governed by the ICCA.

**Scope Change Authority:**
Per Section 4.1 of our Work Order template: "Any changes to the original scope will be added to the planning and will be considered business as usual." This provides the contractual foundation for flexible scope management while ensuring proper documentation and billing transparency.

**Time and Materials Model:**
Our Time and Materials (T&M) approach, as defined in Section 1.3 of our Work Orders, enables responsive scope adjustments where customers are charged for actual time spent and materials used, ensuring cost transparency for scope changes.

### Change Management Principles

**Controlled Flexibility:**
We balance agile responsiveness to changing customer needs with disciplined change control processes that maintain project integrity and stakeholder alignment.

**Transparent Communication:**
All scope changes are documented, communicated, and approved through formal processes that ensure all stakeholders understand implications and impacts.

**Value-Driven Decisions:**
Change requests are evaluated based on business value, technical feasibility, resource impact, and alignment with project objectives.
