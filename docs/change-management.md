# Change Management

## Overview

ZirconTech has established processes to document, manage, and respond to requests for changes to project scope in AWS cloud operations engagements. These practices ensure controlled scope modifications while maintaining project quality and stakeholder alignment.

Our change management is integrated with our contractual framework through Work Orders governed by the Independent Contractor Consulting Agreement (ICCA), as referenced in Section 4.1: "Any changes to the original scope will be added to the planning and will be considered business as usual."
