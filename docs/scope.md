# Scope

## Overview

ZirconTech's Project Scoping methodology provides a systematic approach for determining the scope of work for customer projects with specific criteria, clear deliverables definition, and comprehensive project templates. This framework ensures consistent project definition, stakeholder alignment, and successful delivery outcomes across all AWS cloud operations engagements.

Our scoping process emphasizes thorough discovery, structured analysis, and collaborative definition of project boundaries to prevent scope creep while ensuring all customer requirements are appropriately addressed within defined constraints.

## Scope Determination Process

### Initial Project Assessment

**Project Qualification Framework:**
Every potential project undergoes systematic qualification to determine feasibility, resource requirements, and strategic alignment. Our qualification framework evaluates projects across multiple dimensions to ensure appropriate scoping and resource allocation.

**Business Value Analysis:**
We assess the potential business impact of proposed projects using structured evaluation criteria including strategic alignment with customer objectives, quantifiable business benefits and ROI potential, technical complexity and implementation risk, and resource requirements and timeline constraints.

**Technical Feasibility Assessment:**
Our technical evaluation process examines existing infrastructure and architectural constraints, required AWS services and integration complexity, security and compliance requirements, and scalability and performance requirements to ensure realistic project scoping.

### Stakeholder Discovery and Mapping

**Stakeholder Identification Process:**
We systematically identify all project stakeholders across business and technical domains to ensure comprehensive requirement capture and appropriate project scoping. This includes executive sponsors, business process owners, technical teams, end users, and external partners or vendors.

**Requirements Gathering Framework:**
Our structured requirements gathering process uses multiple techniques to ensure complete requirement capture including stakeholder interviews and workshops, current state assessment and gap analysis, business process documentation and analysis, and technical environment evaluation and documentation.

**Constraint and Assumption Documentation:**
We meticulously document all project constraints and assumptions that impact scope definition including budget limitations and financial constraints, timeline requirements and critical milestones, resource availability and skill requirements, and technical constraints and dependencies.

## Project Scoping Criteria

### Business Criteria

**Strategic Alignment Assessment:**
Projects must demonstrate clear alignment with customer strategic objectives and business priorities. We evaluate how proposed projects support business goals, contribute to competitive advantage, and provide measurable value to the organization.

**Business Impact Evaluation:**
We assess the potential business impact using quantifiable metrics including revenue generation or cost reduction potential, operational efficiency improvements, customer satisfaction enhancement, and risk mitigation or compliance benefits.

**Investment Justification:**
Every project requires clear investment justification including detailed cost-benefit analysis, return on investment calculations, payback period assessment, and total cost of ownership evaluation.

### Technical Criteria

**Architecture Compatibility:**
Proposed solutions must be compatible with existing customer architecture and future technology roadmap. We evaluate integration complexity, scalability requirements, performance expectations, and maintenance implications.

**AWS Service Alignment:**
Projects must leverage appropriate AWS services that provide optimal value for customer requirements. We assess service compatibility, cost optimization opportunities, security and compliance capabilities, and operational management requirements.

**Implementation Feasibility:**
We evaluate technical implementation feasibility including required expertise and skill availability, development and deployment complexity, testing and validation requirements, and operational support considerations.

### Resource Criteria

**Team Availability and Skills:**
Projects require appropriate team composition with necessary skills and availability including AWS expertise and certification requirements, customer-specific knowledge and experience, project management and delivery capabilities, and ongoing support and maintenance capacity.

**Timeline and Milestone Requirements:**
We assess project timeline feasibility and critical milestone requirements including business deadline constraints, technical implementation dependencies, resource allocation and scheduling considerations, and risk mitigation timeline buffers.

**Budget and Financial Constraints:**
Project scoping must align with available budget and financial constraints including total project investment limits, monthly spending and cash flow requirements, contingency and risk mitigation reserves, and ongoing operational cost considerations.
