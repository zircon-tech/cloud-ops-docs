# ZirconTech - AWS Advanced Partner

*Delivering Excellence in Cloud Operations and Generative AI*

## Who We Are

Founded in 2016, ZirconTech emerged from a simple belief: enterprises deserve cloud partners who combine deep technical expertise with clear communication and predictable delivery. What started as a focused blockchain practice has evolved into a comprehensive AWS Advanced Partner helping organizations transform through cloud operations, generative AI, and Web3 technologies.

Based in Montevideo, Uruguay at 8 de Octubre 2956, we serve clients across the Americas and Europe with a remote-first delivery model that prioritizes collaboration through overlapping time zones and responsive communication. Our team of over 50 technology professionals brings diverse expertise across cloud architecture, AI/ML, DevOps, and software engineering.

## What Sets Us Apart

We don't just use AWS—we architect solutions that leverage what makes AWS unique. Every project follows AWS Well-Architected principles from day one, ensuring you get infrastructure that meets enterprise standards for operational excellence, security, reliability, performance, and cost optimization.

You'll never wonder what's happening with your project. Our real-time integration, aligned time zones, and transparent tracking mean you're always informed. We consistently deliver on time through proven processes, automated quality gates, and proactive risk management. Our implementations pass AWS Well-Architected reviews, include comprehensive testing, and follow security best practices as standard.

## Our Customers

We work with organizations ranging from innovative startups to Fortune 500 enterprises. In financial services, we build payment platforms, custody solutions, and regulatory compliance frameworks. Healthcare organizations trust us with HIPAA-compliant applications and secure patient data processing. Web3 and blockchain companies partner with us for token platforms, creator economies, and real estate tokenization. We also serve real estate firms with property management and investment platforms, along with SaaS companies building multi-tenant architectures and scalable API platforms.

Our clients span three continents, with particularly strong presence in North America where our near-shore model provides optimal collaboration. We've delivered over 100 projects across web, mobile, blockchain, and cloud technologies, building deep expertise in both technical implementation and business outcomes.

## AWS Partner Excellence

AWS has audited and granted our Cloud Operations Services Competency, validating our expertise in multi-account governance, cost optimization, security and compliance, and operational excellence. Our Generative AI Services capabilities demonstrate proficiency in readiness assessment, foundation model customization, production deployment, and responsible AI implementation.

We maintain Advanced-level AWS Service Validations for Lambda Delivery, API Gateway Delivery, and our Cloud Operations Accelerator. Our team holds current AWS certifications including Solutions Architect, DevOps Professional, Machine Learning Specialty, AI Engineer, and AI Practitioner credentials, ensuring we stay current with AWS innovations.

## Cloud Operations Excellence

When organizations need multi-account governance, we design and implement enterprise-grade AWS Organizations structures with centralized control, automated compliance, and clear cost allocation. Our approach to cost optimization achieves significant reductions through systematic analysis, right-sizing, Reserved Instance optimization, and comprehensive FinOps practices that provide unprecedented visibility into spending patterns.

Security and compliance form the foundation of everything we build. We implement layered security controls meeting SOC 2, HIPAA, and financial services requirements using AWS-native security services. Our observability implementations establish comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and analytics providing full visibility into application and infrastructure performance.

We automate everything through Infrastructure as Code, using Terraform, CloudFormation, or Serverless Framework with CI/CD pipelines ensuring consistent, repeatable deployments. This approach eliminates configuration drift and enables rapid, confident changes to production systems.

## Generative AI Implementation

Strategic assessment is where successful GenAI initiatives begin. We evaluate organizational readiness, identify high-value use cases, and develop adoption roadmaps aligned with business objectives. This ensures GenAI investments deliver measurable business value rather than becoming technology experiments.

Model selection and customization requires navigating complex foundation model options. We implement RAG architectures, optimize prompts, and customize models for specific requirements, leveraging Amazon Bedrock for managed model access or SageMaker for deeper customization needs. Our approach considers cost, performance, and business requirements to select the right foundation model and customization strategy.

Production deployment of GenAI applications demands robust MLOps, monitoring, security controls, and continuous optimization. We operationalize GenAI with the same rigor as mission-critical business systems, ensuring reliability, performance, and cost-effectiveness. Responsible AI implementation includes bias detection, transparency measures, user consent frameworks, and compliance controls ensuring ethical deployment.

Continuous improvement establishes feedback loops, performance monitoring, and iterative optimization maintaining sustained value. GenAI systems improve over time through systematic incorporation of user feedback, model retraining, and performance optimization.

## Why AWS With ZirconTech

AWS provides unique advantages we leverage for your benefit. The Well-Architected Framework offers a systematic approach to operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization that exists only within AWS. We implement solutions following these five pillars, ensuring your infrastructure meets enterprise standards from day one.

Multi-account governance reaches enterprise scale through AWS Organizations, Control Tower, and Service Control Policies. This governance sophistication is impossible on other platforms. We design account structures supporting your organizational model with automated compliance and clear cost allocation, enabling both centralized control and team autonomy.

AWS pioneered serverless computing and offers the richest ecosystem. We build solutions leveraging Lambda, API Gateway, EventBridge, and Step Functions that scale automatically while minimizing operational overhead and cost. Serverless architectures eliminate server management, reduce operational complexity, and provide pay-per-use pricing that dramatically lowers costs for variable workloads.

Advanced cost engineering becomes possible through AWS's sophisticated cost management tools. We leverage Cost Explorer, Budgets, Cost Categories, and custom QuickSight dashboards to provide unprecedented cost visibility and optimization opportunities. This level of granular cost analysis and optimization simply doesn't exist on other cloud platforms.

Amazon Bedrock provides managed access to leading foundation models with enterprise security. Combined with SageMaker's comprehensive MLOps capabilities, AWS offers the most complete platform for production GenAI applications. We leverage these services to deliver GenAI solutions that meet enterprise requirements for security, compliance, and operational excellence.

Event-driven architectures reach their full potential on AWS. EventBridge, SQS, SNS, and native AWS service integrations enable systems that decouple components, improve resilience, and scale automatically. These capabilities emerge from AWS's integrated service ecosystem and simply aren't available with the same richness on other platforms.

## Web3 and Blockchain on AWS

AWS-native Web3 applications leverage serverless architectures, managed databases, and security services for scalable, cost-effective blockchain solutions. We build systems that connect traditional applications with blockchain technologies through secure APIs, custody integration, and smart contract interaction, all running on AWS infrastructure optimized for performance and cost.
