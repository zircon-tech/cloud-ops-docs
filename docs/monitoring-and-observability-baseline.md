# Monitoring and Observability Baseline

## Purpose

Comprehensive monitoring and observability baseline provides the visibility needed to maintain performance, availability, and security across your AWS environment. Our approach establishes end-to-end monitoring that enables proactive incident response and continuous optimization.

## Methodology & Process

### Telemetry Architecture Design

**Signal Collection Strategy**: We implement comprehensive telemetry collection using OpenTelemetry standards, capturing metrics, logs, and traces across your entire application stack.

**Correlation and Context**: All telemetry signals are correlated through consistent trace IDs and metadata, enabling rapid troubleshooting and root cause analysis.

### Alerting and Response

**Intelligent Alerting**: Alert strategies focus on actionable signals that indicate real user impact, reducing alert fatigue while ensuring critical issues receive immediate attention.

**Incident Response Integration**: Monitoring integrates with your existing incident response processes, automatically creating tickets and escalating based on severity and business impact.

### Evidence Artifacts Included

**Monitoring Templates**: CloudWatch dashboard configurations and alerting rule sets
**Trace Analysis**: Sample X-Ray service maps and distributed tracing implementations
**Log Analytics**: CloudWatch Insights queries and log aggregation pipeline code
**SLA Definitions**: Service level objectives with monitoring and alerting thresholds

## Technology Stack

| Layer | AWS Services | Alternative Options |
|-------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Core** | Amazon CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray, Amazon Managed Prometheus, Amazon Managed Grafana | |
| **Logging** | CloudWatch Logs, Amazon OpenSearch, AWS Fluent Bit, AWS Kinesis Data Firehose | |
| **Tracing** | AWS X-Ray, OpenTelemetry Collector, Amazon ECS Service Connect, AWS App Mesh | |
| **Third-Party** | — | Datadog (Unified observability), New Relic (Application monitoring), Splunk (Log analytics) |


## 1. Monitoring and Observability Baseline Methodology and Process

### Discovery Phase

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Collaborative workshops with technical teams, business stakeholders, and decision-makers to understand current state, requirements, and success criteria.

**Current State Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of existing observability capabilities, identifying gaps, opportunities, and constraints.

**Requirements Analysis**: Documentation of functional and non-functional requirements aligned with business objectives and compliance needs.

### Design Phase

**Solution Architecture**: Design of target state architecture incorporating AWS best practices, security requirements, and scalability considerations.

**Implementation Planning**: Detailed project plan with phases, milestones, dependencies, and resource allocation.

**Risk Assessment**: Identification and mitigation strategies for technical, operational, and business risks.

### Implementation Phase

**Iterative Deployment**: Phased implementation approach with regular checkpoints and validation gates.

**Testing and Validation**: Comprehensive testing including functional, performance, security, and user acceptance testing.

**Documentation and Training**: Knowledge transfer through documentation, training sessions, and hands-on workshops.

### Operations Phase

**Monitoring and Support**: Ongoing monitoring, incident response, and continuous improvement processes.

**Optimization**: Regular reviews and optimization recommendations based on usage patterns and performance metrics.

# Create custom CloudWatch dashboard
aws cloudwatch put-dashboard \
    --dashboard-name "ApplicationObservability" \
    --dashboard-body file://dashboard-config.json
