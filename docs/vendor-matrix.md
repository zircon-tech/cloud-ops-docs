# Vendor Capability Matrix

## Purpose

This template provides a structured framework for evaluating third-party tools and vendors against key criteria relevant to AWS cloud environments. Organizations can customize the evaluation criteria based on their specific requirements.

## Evaluation Framework

| Evaluation Criteria | Description | Scoring Approach |
|---------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Category** | Tool category (Security, Monitoring, DevOps, etc.) | Classification for organization |
| **AWS Integration** | Native AWS service integrations and API compatibility | 1-5 scale based on integration depth |
| **Compliance Certifications** | Security and compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.) | Pass/fail with specific requirements |
| **Pricing Model** | Cost structure and predictability | Evaluation based on budget and usage patterns |
| **Support Quality** | Vendor support responsiveness and quality | Assessment based on SLA requirements |
| **Deployment Complexity** | Ease of implementation and ongoing maintenance | Resource requirements and timeline impact |

## Sample Evaluation Matrix

| Vendor / Product | Category | AWS Integration Score | Compliance Status | Pricing Assessment | Support Rating | Implementation Effort |
|------------------|----------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| *[Vendor A]* | *[Category]* | *[1-5]* | *[Pass/Fail]* | *[Low/Med/High]* | *[1-5]* | *[Low/Med/High]* |
| *[Vendor B]* | *[Category]* | *[1-5]* | *[Pass/Fail]* | *[Low/Med/High]* | *[1-5]* | *[Low/Med/High]* |
| *[Vendor C]* | *[Category]* | *[1-5]* | *[Pass/Fail]* | *[Low/Med/High]* | *[1-5]* | *[Low/Med/High]* |

## Evaluation Process

1. **Requirements Definition**: Document specific needs and constraints
2. **Vendor Research**: Identify potential solutions meeting basic criteria
3. **Initial Screening**: Apply pass/fail criteria for compliance and budget
4. **Detailed Assessment**: Score vendors against evaluation framework
5. **Proof of Concept**: Test top candidates in controlled environments
6. **Final Selection**: Document decision rationale and approval

## Customization Guidelines

Organizations should adapt this framework by:
- Adding industry-specific compliance requirements
- Adjusting scoring criteria based on organizational priorities  
- Including additional evaluation dimensions relevant to their use case
- Setting threshold scores for advancement to next evaluation phase

*This template should be updated regularly as new vendors are evaluated and organizational requirements evolve.*
