# Planning, Forecasting & Total-Cost Analysis

## 1 · Purpose  
Give customers repeatable tools and models to forecast AWS spend, quantify business value, and validate outcomes after migration or new-workload launch.

## 2 · Capability Matrix

| Checklist Capability | ZirconTech Implementation |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Inventory-based TCO analysis** | • Import on-prem CMDB or RVTools export into **Migration Evaluator**  <br>• Model lift-and-shift vs. right-sized / modernized workloads |
| **Value quantification pre- vs. post-migration** | • Baseline on-prem OpEx/CapEx, support contracts, licensing  <br>• Post-migration KPI dashboard tracks agility gains, MTTR, release cadence |
| **Optimized pricing models (RI/SP, EDP)** | • Run **AWS Pricing Calculator** scenarios for On-Demand, Savings Plans, PPAs  <br>• Build blended plan recommending mix of Compute SP + EC2 RI + Spot |
| **Bottom-up forecasts for net-new workloads** | • Terraform module outputs resource counts → Lambda pushes to **Athena forecast table**  <br>• QuickSight "Build-out vs. Budget" dashboard auto-refreshes daily |
| **Demand-driver forecasting (unit economics)** | • Join CUR with business KPIs (MAU, GB stored) to create regression model $/unit  <br>• Use driver projections from product roadmap CSV |
| **Value realization beyond cost savings** | • KPI set: revenue-per-developer, release frequency, customer churn, outage minutes  <br>• Tag resources to features → correlate spend to revenue lines |
| **Predictive month/quarter/year estimates** | • Athena query feeds **Amazon Forecast** (Prophet algorithm) for 12-mo projection  <br>• Budget alerts compare actual vs. forecast with ±5 % tolerance |
| **TTM trend analysis** | • Glue crawler partitions CUR → Athena view `vw_ttm_costs`  <br>• QuickSight visual "Rolling 12-Month Spend & YoY Δ" |

## 3 · Methodology & Process

### Phase 1 – Discovery & Data Collection  
1. Import hardware/software inventory (CSV, RVTools, CMDB API).  
2. Interview app owners for performance baselines & business KPIs.  
3. Export trailing 12-month invoices and on-prem cost sheets.

### Phase 2 – Modeling  
| Model | Tool | Key Outputs |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Lift-and-shift TCO | **Migration Evaluator** | 3-yr amortized OpEx, break-even chart |
| Right-size / Modernize | **AWS Pricing Calculator**, **Compute Optimizer** | RI/SP mix & per-service savings |
| Demand-driver forecast | **Athena + Amazon Forecast** | Low/Med/High spend scenarios |
| New-workload bottoms-up | Terraform sizing + Pricing Calculator CSV import | Per-feature monthly budget |

### Phase 3 – Review & Commit  
* Stakeholders choose a target scenario.  
* Finance locks budgets; DevOps sets Budgets & anomaly alerts.  
* EDP / Private Offer negotiations launched if commit tier exceeded.

### Phase 4 – Validation & Continuous Improvement  
* Post-migration "Day 30 / Day 90" checkpoint compares actual vs. forecast.  
* Quarterly slice: update driver assumptions, refresh regression model.  
* Annual refresh: re-assess RI/SP coverage, capacity reservations.
