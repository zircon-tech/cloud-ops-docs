# Define Multi-Account Strategy for the Organization

## Overview

Establishing a comprehensive multi-account strategy is fundamental to enterprise AWS success. This capability enables organizations to implement security boundaries, operational controls, and cost management frameworks that scale effectively across business units and environments.

ZirconTech provides proven methodologies and automation frameworks that transform ad-hoc AWS usage into governed, scalable environments supporting innovation while maintaining security and compliance standards.

## Our Approach

### Comprehensive Methodology

Our multi-account strategy implementation follows battle-tested principles refined through hundreds of enterprise engagements. The methodology encompasses discovery, design, implementation, and ongoing governance phases that ensure sustainable long-term success.

**For detailed methodology, implementation phases, and design principles**: See [Multi-Account Strategy Methodology](multi-account-methodology.md)

### Key Capabilities

- **AWS Organizations and Control Tower Implementation**: Automated landing zone deployment with mandatory guardrails
- **Account Factory Automation**: Streamlined account provisioning using AWS Control Tower Account Factory or Account Factory for Terraform (AFT)
- **Service Control Policy (SCP) Framework**: Preventive controls enforcing security and compliance requirements
- **Organizational Unit (OU) Design**: Shallow hierarchy optimized for operational efficiency
- **Identity Integration**: AWS IAM Identity Center integration with existing identity providers

### Technology Foundation

| Component | Primary Services | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Foundation** | AWS Organizations, AWS Control Tower | Core multi-account framework and guardrails |
| **Automation** | Account Factory, AFT, AWS Lambda | Automated account provisioning and configuration |
| **Security** | Service Control Policies, AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail | Preventive and detective controls |
| **Identity** | AWS IAM Identity Center, AWS Directory Service | Centralized identity and access management |
| **Monitoring** | AWS CloudWatch, AWS Security Hub, AWS GuardDuty | Continuous monitoring and compliance |

## Implementation Approach

### Discovery and Design
- Current state assessment and organizational mapping
- Requirements gathering and compliance analysis  
- Target state architecture design
- Implementation roadmap development

### Deployment and Integration
- AWS Control Tower landing zone deployment
- Account Factory configuration and testing
- Service Control Policy implementation
- Identity provider integration

### Validation and Handover
- Security and compliance testing
- Operational runbook development
- Knowledge transfer and training
- Ongoing governance framework establishment

## Deliverables

### Technical Artifacts
- **Configured AWS Control Tower Landing Zone**: Production-ready multi-account foundation
- **Account Factory Pipeline**: Automated account provisioning with baseline configurations
- **Service Control Policy Library**: Comprehensive set of preventive controls
- **Organizational Unit Structure**: Optimized hierarchy with clear governance boundaries

### Documentation and Training
- **Architecture Documentation**: Detailed design rationale and implementation guide
- **Operational Runbooks**: Step-by-step procedures for account management and governance
- **Knowledge Transfer Sessions**: Hands-on training for operations teams
- **Governance Framework**: Ongoing management and optimization processes

## Engagement Details

**For comprehensive project scope, timeline, and deliverables**: See [Multi-Account Strategy SOW](sow-multi-account-strategy.md)

### Project Structure
- **Duration**: 4-week implementation timeline
- **Phases**: Discovery, Design, Build, Validate, Knowledge Transfer
- **Team**: Project manager, landing zone engineer, security lead
- **Deliverables**: Configured landing zone, automation pipeline, documentation package

### Success Criteria
- All Control Tower guardrails in "Mandatory" state
- Successful account creation via Account Factory
- Security validation and compliance sign-off
- Operations team trained and ready for production support
