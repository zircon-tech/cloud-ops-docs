# Identify, Remediate and Report Security Vulnerabilities

## Evidence Documentation

### 1. Methodology and Processes for Discovery, Continuous Monitoring, Scoring, Ranking, and Event-Based Remediations

#### Discovery and Continuous Scanning Methodology

We can implement continuous discovery and scanning of workloads using AWS Inspector for EC2 instances and container images, AWS Security Hub for centralized security findings aggregation, and AWS Config for infrastructure misconfigurations. Our discovery process includes automated asset inventory using AWS Systems Manager Inventory, network topology discovery through VPC Flow Logs analysis, and application dependency mapping.

**Discovery Process:**
We can establish automated discovery workflows that continuously identify new resources, scan for vulnerabilities upon resource creation, classify assets by criticality and exposure, and maintain an up-to-date inventory of all AWS infrastructure components.

**Continuous Monitoring Implementation:**
We can implement real-time monitoring using AWS CloudWatch Events to trigger scans when resources are created or modified, scheduled scanning using AWS Lambda functions for periodic vulnerability assessments, and integration with AWS Config Rules for continuous compliance monitoring.

#### Vulnerability Scoring and Prioritization Methodology

We can implement vulnerability scoring using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores combined with environmental factors specific to the AWS environment. Our scoring methodology considers asset criticality, network exposure, data sensitivity, and business impact to create a comprehensive risk score.

**Scoring Framework:**
We can establish a scoring system that combines CVSS base scores with environmental factors including internet accessibility, data classification levels, business criticality ratings, and existing compensating controls to prioritize vulnerabilities based on actual risk to the organization.

**Prioritization Process:**
We can implement automated prioritization that ranks vulnerabilities by risk score, considers exploit availability and threat intelligence, accounts for asset criticality and business impact, and integrates with existing risk management frameworks to ensure consistent prioritization across the organization.

#### Event-Based Remediation Methodology

We can implement event-driven remediation workflows that trigger automated responses based on vulnerability severity, asset type, and business impact. Our remediation process includes automated patching for approved vulnerabilities, configuration remediation using AWS Config remediation actions, and escalation procedures for critical vulnerabilities requiring manual intervention.

**Automated Remediation Workflows:**
We can establish automated remediation using AWS Systems Manager Automation documents for common vulnerability types, AWS Config remediation actions for configuration issues, AWS Lambda functions for custom remediation logic, and integration with change management systems for tracking remediation activities.

**Manual Remediation Processes:**
We can implement manual remediation workflows for complex vulnerabilities that include detailed remediation procedures, approval workflows for high-risk changes, coordination with application teams for application-specific vulnerabilities, and tracking and reporting of remediation progress.

**Reporting and Metrics:**
We can implement comprehensive reporting that tracks vulnerability discovery rates, mean time to remediation, remediation success rates, and trending analysis to identify patterns and improvement opportunities.

### 2. AWS Services and Tools Used

#### AWS Security Services

**AWS Security Hub:** We can implement AWS Security Hub as the central security findings aggregation service to normalize and prioritize security findings from multiple AWS security services and third-party tools. Security Hub provides automated security checks against industry standards and integrates with AWS Config, AWS Inspector, and AWS GuardDuty.

**AWS Inspector:** We can implement AWS Inspector for automated security assessments of EC2 instances and container images. Inspector provides vulnerability assessments for software packages, network configuration analysis, and integration with AWS Systems Manager for automated patching.

**AWS Config:** We can implement AWS Config for continuous monitoring of AWS resource configurations and compliance with security policies. Config provides configuration change tracking, compliance monitoring with AWS Config Rules, and automated remediation capabilities.

**AWS GuardDuty:** We can implement AWS GuardDuty for threat detection using machine learning to identify malicious activity and unauthorized behavior. GuardDuty provides DNS data analysis, VPC Flow Logs analysis, and CloudTrail event analysis.

**AWS Systems Manager:** We can implement AWS Systems Manager for patch management, configuration management, and automated remediation. Systems Manager provides Patch Manager for automated patching, Session Manager for secure access, and Automation documents for remediation workflows.

#### Supporting AWS Services

**AWS CloudWatch:** We can implement CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting on security metrics, creating custom dashboards for vulnerability management, and triggering automated responses through CloudWatch Events.

**AWS Lambda:** We can implement Lambda functions for custom vulnerability scanning logic, automated remediation workflows, and integration with third-party security tools.

**AWS Step Functions:** We can implement Step Functions for orchestrating complex remediation workflows that require multiple steps and approval processes.

**AWS CloudTrail:** We can implement CloudTrail for logging and monitoring API calls related to security events and remediation activities.

#### Third-Party and Open-Source Tools

**Vulnerability Scanners:** We can integrate third-party vulnerability scanners for specialized scanning capabilities, including network vulnerability scanners, application security testing tools, and container security scanners.

**SIEM Integration:** We can integrate with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for centralized security monitoring, correlation of security events, and compliance reporting.

**Ticketing Systems:** We can integrate with IT Service Management (ITSM) platforms for tracking remediation activities, managing approval workflows, and reporting on remediation progress.

**Threat Intelligence:** We can integrate with threat intelligence feeds to enhance vulnerability prioritization based on active threats and exploit availability.
