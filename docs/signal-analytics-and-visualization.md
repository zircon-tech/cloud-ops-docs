# Signal Analytics and Visualization

## Overview

The AWS Partner has methodology, process and relevant tooling experience to analyze and visualize signals, manage alerts through signal correlation, interactive search in log data, SQL query functionality, statistical analysis, and time-series analysis. Our visualization capabilities include live dashboards, trend analysis, and end-to-end service mapping for distributed systems, with alerts managed based on metric monitoring and customer-defined thresholds.

## Evidence Documentation

### 1. Standard Processes for Creating Visualization Dashboards

Our dashboard creation methodology follows a structured approach beginning with signal identification across application, infrastructure, and business layers. We integrate multiple data sources including CloudWatch metrics, X-Ray traces, OpenSearch logs, and custom business metrics, establishing correlation relationships through trace IDs and consistent metadata tagging.

**Signal Correlation and Analysis**

The platform performs cross-service correlation linking application performance with infrastructure health, temporal correlation to identify time-based patterns, and causal analysis for root cause determination. Statistical anomaly detection algorithms identify unusual patterns automatically, while CloudWatch Insights provides SQL-like queries for log analysis and OpenSearch Dashboards enable interactive search across structured and unstructured data.

**Interactive Analytics**

Custom query builders provide user-friendly interfaces for complex data exploration, with saved searches serving as reusable templates for common investigations. Time-series analysis includes top contributors identification, trend detection with statistical forecasting, performance benchmarking against historical baselines, and predictive analysis for capacity planning.

**Dashboard Development Process**

Requirements gathering through stakeholder workshops identifies key metrics and visualization needs for different audiences. Template development creates reusable dashboard configurations with standard widget types and consistent visual patterns. Implementation uses Infrastructure as Code through CloudFormation or CDK for deployment, with dashboard configurations version-controlled in Git and automated testing for functionality validation.

**Alert Management**

Threshold configuration begins with statistical analysis to determine normal operating ranges, followed by dynamic thresholds using machine learning for adaptive alerting. Service quota monitoring provides proactive alerts before reaching AWS limits, while custom business metrics support customer-defined KPIs. Alert lifecycle management includes automated generation, tiered escalation based on severity, alert correlation to reduce noise, and automated closure with post-incident analysis.

### 2. Reference Dashboards and Examples

**Executive Business Dashboard**

This high-level dashboard provides business stakeholders with revenue per hour, active users, transaction volumes, and overall service availability. The visualization includes executive summary cards with trend indicators, revenue trend analysis, service health heatmaps, and geographic distribution of user activity. Key insights derived include business impact correlation with technical performance, cost optimization opportunities, regional performance variations, and security incident impact on operations.

**Operations Dashboard**

Real-time operational monitoring displays infrastructure metrics including CPU, memory, and disk utilization alongside application performance data such as response times and error rates. The service map visualization shows end-to-end distributed system health with live updating gauges for critical indicators. This dashboard enables performance bottleneck identification, service dependency impact analysis, incident correlation and pattern recognition, plus resource optimization recommendations.

**Developer Performance Dashboard**

Development teams access application-specific metrics including feature usage, API performance, and error patterns. Deployment health tracking shows build success rates and rollback frequency, while code quality metrics display test coverage and technical debt. The feature adoption funnel analyzes user interaction patterns, API performance matrices break down response times by endpoint, and error analysis provides frequency and impact assessment for optimization opportunities.

**Security Operations Dashboard**

Security monitoring consolidates login attempts, access patterns, vulnerability metrics, and compliance status. The threat intelligence feed correlates real-time security events while compliance scorecards track policy adherence trends. Geographic threat mapping shows attack sources and patterns, with incident response timelines tracking security event lifecycles. This enables threat pattern recognition, compliance gap identification, security posture improvements, and incident response effectiveness measurement.

### 3. Dashboard Security Access Control Policies

**Role-Based Access Control Implementation**

Executive access is restricted to high-level business dashboards through IAM policies limiting CloudWatch and QuickSight dashboard access to resources tagged with "Executive-*" patterns. Operations teams receive full CloudWatch, X-Ray, and log query permissions while being denied modification rights to executive dashboards. Developer access is scoped to development-specific dashboards and X-Ray service maps for their applications.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["cloudwatch:GetDashboard", "cloudwatch:ListDashboards"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudwatch:*:*:dashboard/Executive-*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Multi-Account Access Control**

Cross-account dashboard sharing uses centralized IAM roles allowing dashboard viewer access to metrics across multiple AWS accounts. This enables consolidated monitoring while maintaining security boundaries through resource-based policies and conditional access controls.

**Data Classification and Protection**

Sensitive data access follows classification levels with PII protection restricting access to personally identifiable information, financial data separation for revenue and cost visualizations, limited security data access for incident response dashboards, and compliance data with audit trail protection and read-only controls.

Access control implementation includes IP address restrictions, regional access limitations, and time-based access controls through CloudFormation templates that define dashboard access policies with conditional statements for enhanced security.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a four-phase approach beginning with signal analysis setup including correlation framework implementation and statistical analysis tools configuration. Dashboard development creates reference templates and deploys live dashboards with trend analysis. Alert management implements threshold configuration and escalation procedures, while security and access control establishes RBAC policies and multi-account access with data classification protection.

## Success Metrics

Dashboard adoption exceeds 90% of teams using standardized dashboards, with alert accuracy above 95% and fewer than 5% false positives. Mean time to insight remains under 2 minutes for common troubleshooting scenarios, security compliance maintains 100% adherence to access control policies, and user satisfaction scores exceed 85% in dashboard usability surveys.
