### 1. Standard Processes for Creating Visualization Dashboards

#### Dashboard Creation Methodology

**Signal Collection and Preparation**

1. **Signal Identification**: Define key signals across application, infrastructure, and business layers
2. **Data Source Integration**: Connect multiple data sources (CloudWatch, X-Ray, OpenSearch, custom metrics)
3. **Signal Correlation**: Establish relationships between related signals using trace IDs and metadata
4. **Data Normalization**: Standardize signal formats and units for consistent visualization

**Dashboard Design Process**

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Stakeholder workshops to identify key metrics and visualization needs
   - Define audience-specific dashboard requirements (executives, operations, developers)
   - Establish refresh rates and real-time vs. historical data requirements

2. **Template Development**
   - Create reusable dashboard templates for common use cases
   - Define standard widget types and configurations
   - Establish consistent color schemes and layout patterns

3. **Implementation Standards**
