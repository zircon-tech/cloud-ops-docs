# Statement of Work

## Purpose

Our statement of work methodology provides enterprise-grade processes and tooling that scale with your organization's AWS adoption.

## Methodology & Process

### Discovery and Assessment

We begin with comprehensive discovery to understand your current environment, identify requirements, and establish success criteria that align with business objectives.

### Design and Implementation

Our implementation approach prioritizes automation, consistency, and maintainability, using infrastructure-as-code and proven architectural patterns.

### Monitoring and Optimization

Continuous monitoring ensures implementations remain effective over time, with regular reviews and optimization recommendations.



## Technology Stack

| Layer | AWS Services | Alternative Options |
|-------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Core** | Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudFormation, AWS IAM, Amazon VPC | |
| **Third-Party** | â€” | Third-party tools (As required) |


## 1. Statement of Work: Statement of Work Implementation

### Project Overview

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive statement of work solution using AWS native services and industry best practices.

**Scope**: End-to-end project implementation including design, deployment, testing, and knowledge transfer.

**Duration**: 8-12 weeks depending on complexity and requirements

### Deliverables

#### Phase 1: Discovery and Design (2-3 weeks)
- Current state assessment and gap analysis
- Target state architecture design
- Implementation roadmap and project plan
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

#### Phase 2: Implementation (4-6 weeks)
- Infrastructure deployment and configuration
- Service integration and testing
- Security implementation and validation
- Performance optimization and tuning

#### Phase 3: Testing and Validation (1-2 weeks)
- Functional and integration testing
- Performance and security testing
- User acceptance testing
- Documentation review and finalization

#### Phase 4: Knowledge Transfer (1 week)
- Technical documentation handover
- Training sessions for operations teams
- Runbook development and review
- Go-live support and transition

### Success Criteria

- **Functionality**: All requirements implemented and validated
- **Performance**: Meets or exceeds performance benchmarks
- **Security**: Passes security review and compliance audit
- **Operations**: Teams trained and ready for production support

### Assumptions and Dependencies

- Customer provides necessary access and resources
- Existing infrastructure meets minimum requirements
- Stakeholders available for requirements gathering and validation
- Change management processes followed for production deployment



## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| 1. Discovery | 1-2 weeks | Requirements gathering, current state assessment | Discovery document, requirements matrix |
| 2. Design | 2-3 weeks | Architecture design, tool selection, process definition | Design document, implementation plan |
| 3. Implementation | 3-6 weeks | Deployment, configuration, testing, validation | Working solution, documentation |
| 4. Knowledge Transfer | 1 week | Training, handover, ongoing support planning | Training materials, runbooks |

## Deliverables

1. **Statement of Work Methodology Document** (this document)
2. **Implementation Runbook** (see Implementation Artifacts section)
3. **Infrastructure as Code** templates (see Implementation Artifacts section)
4. **Configuration Standards** and baseline policies (see Implementation Artifacts section)
5. **Knowledge Transfer Session** recording and materials

## Implementation Artifacts


## Implementation Runbook

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Terraform/CloudFormation deployment tools
- Access to target AWS accounts

### Step 1: Assessment and Planning

3. Create implementation timeline and resource allocation
4. Validate prerequisite services and permissions

### Step 2: Foundation Setup
1. Deploy base infrastructure components
2. Configure monitoring and logging
3. Implement security baselines
4. Test connectivity and access

### Step 3: Statement of Work Implementation
1. Deploy core statement of work components
2. Configure automation and workflows
3. Implement monitoring and alerting
4. Validate functionality and performance

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
1. Execute comprehensive test scenarios
2. Validate security and compliance controls
3. Performance testing and optimization
4. Document configuration and operational procedures

### Step 5: Go-Live and Handover
1. Production deployment coordination
2. User training and documentation handover
3. Establish ongoing support procedures
4. Schedule periodic review and optimization



## Configuration Standards

### Baseline Security Policies

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "EnforceStatementofWorkSecurity",
      "Effect": "Deny", 
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tagging Standards

```yaml
required_tags:
  - CostCenter: "String identifying cost allocation"
  - Project: "Project or application identifier"
  - Environment: "prod|staging|dev|test"
  - Owner: "Team or individual responsible"
  - DataClassification: "public|internal|confidential|restricted"

enforcement:
  method: "Service Control Policy + AWS Config Rules"
  frequency: "Real-time prevention + daily compliance scan"
```
