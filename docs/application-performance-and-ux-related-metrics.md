# Application Performance and UX Related Metrics

## Overview

The AWS Partner has methodology, process and relevant tooling experience to identify and recommend specific metrics used to measure the performance and user experience of applications. Our approach provides comprehensive visibility into application behavior from both synthetic testing and real user interactions, enabling data-driven optimization decisions.

## Evidence Documentation

### 1. Real-User Monitoring (RUM)

#### Web Application Telemetry Framework

Our real-user monitoring capability helps identify and debug issues in client-side web applications through comprehensive telemetry collection covering performance metrics, core web vitals, and error tracking. The framework captures actual user experiences across different browsers, devices, and network conditions.

**Performance and Timing Metrics Collection**

Web application components emit telemetry through Amazon CloudWatch RUM integration with JavaScript instrumentation. The RUM agent automatically captures page load performance including Navigation Timing API metrics, Resource Timing data, and First Contentful Paint measurements. Core Web Vitals monitoring tracks Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) to measure user experience quality.

Custom timing metrics collection captures business-specific performance indicators including form submission times, search response latency, and checkout process duration. The instrumentation leverages User Timing API marks and measures for precise application workflow tracking with minimal performance overhead.

**Error Detection and Reporting**

JavaScript error monitoring captures both runtime errors and promise rejections with full stack traces and user session context. HTTP error tracking monitors API response codes, request failures, and network timeouts with correlation to specific user actions and application features.

Error classification categorizes issues by severity, frequency, and user impact to prioritize remediation efforts. Session recording integration provides detailed user interaction context for complex error scenarios, enabling rapid root cause identification.

**Implementation Process**

The RUM implementation begins with CloudWatch RUM application configuration including domain allowlisting, session sample rates, and telemetry destinations. JavaScript snippet integration requires minimal code changes with automatic instrumentation for standard web performance metrics.

Custom metrics implementation extends the base configuration with business-specific tracking using the RUM agent API for form interactions, feature usage, and conversion funnel analysis. Data retention policies and dashboard configuration provide ongoing visibility into application performance trends and user experience quality.

### 2. Synthetic Monitoring (Canary)

#### Methodology and Reference Architecture

Our synthetic monitoring capability provides continuous verification of end-customer experience through automated testing that follows the same routes and actions as real customers, even during periods of no actual traffic.

**Implementation Reference**

Comprehensive synthetic monitoring methodology, process documentation, and reference architecture are detailed in the [Synthetic Monitoring document](synthetic-monitoring.md). This includes artifact management for defining, developing, and managing synthetic monitoring across hybrid workloads, complete reference architecture with diagrams, and typical AWS services integration patterns.

The synthetic monitoring framework utilizes Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics for automated canary testing with configurable scheduling, geographic distribution, and alert integration. Testing scenarios cover critical user journeys including authentication flows, transaction processing, and API health validation.

### 3. Feature Flags and A/B Test Monitoring

#### Controlled Feature Launch Framework

Our feature flag and A/B test monitoring capability provides controlled rollout of new application features with comprehensive performance tracking and risk mitigation. The framework monitors feature performance during controlled traffic ramp-up to identify unintended consequences before full launch.

**Tooling and Mechanisms**

Amazon CloudWatch Evidently provides the core feature flag and experiment management platform with integrated performance monitoring. Feature evaluation rules define user segments, traffic allocation percentages, and launch criteria with automatic traffic shifting based on performance thresholds.

Performance monitoring during feature launches tracks application metrics including response times, error rates, conversion rates, and business KPIs. Automated analysis compares treatment groups against control groups with statistical significance testing to validate feature effectiveness.

**Evaluation Rules and Audience Management**

Traffic allocation policies define percentage-based rollouts with user segmentation based on geographic location, device type, or custom attributes. Evaluation rules specify launch criteria including performance thresholds, error rate limits, and business metric targets that must be maintained for continued rollout.

Audience targeting enables feature testing with specific user segments while maintaining control group isolation. Geographic targeting allows regional feature launches with localized performance monitoring and rollback capabilities.

**Performance Analysis and Optimization**

Real-time dashboard monitoring displays feature performance metrics with automated alerting for threshold violations. A/B test analysis provides statistical comparison of feature variants with confidence intervals and recommendation engines for optimization decisions.

Performance trend analysis identifies long-term impact of feature changes on application behavior and user experience. Automated reporting generates optimization recommendations based on user engagement patterns, conversion rate changes, and infrastructure utilization impacts.

**Improvement Recommendations Framework**

Data-driven optimization recommendations analyze feature performance against business objectives including user engagement, conversion rates, and operational efficiency. Recommendations include traffic allocation adjustments, feature configuration changes, and rollback procedures for underperforming variants.

Continuous optimization processes monitor feature lifecycle from initial launch through full deployment with regular performance reviews and adjustment recommendations. Integration with development workflows provides feedback loops for feature improvement and future launch planning.

## Implementation Process

Application performance monitoring implementation begins with stakeholder requirements gathering to identify critical user journeys, business metrics, and performance thresholds. Implementation follows a phased approach with real-user monitoring baseline establishment, synthetic testing deployment, and feature flag framework integration.

Testing and validation ensure accurate data collection across different user segments and application scenarios. Ongoing optimization includes dashboard refinement, alert tuning, and metric enhancement based on operational feedback and business requirements.

## Success Metrics

Real-user monitoring effectiveness measures include 95% data collection coverage across user sessions, sub-second telemetry ingestion latency, and comprehensive error tracking with detailed context. Synthetic monitoring maintains 99.9% test execution reliability with automated alerting for customer-impacting issues.

Feature flag monitoring provides statistical confidence in A/B test results with automated traffic management and rollback capabilities for performance degradations exceeding defined thresholds.
