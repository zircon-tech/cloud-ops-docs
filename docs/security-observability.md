# Detect and Auto-Remediate Incidents in Real Time

## Overview

The AWS Partner has methodology, process and relevant tooling experience to enable customers to implement automated remediation of detected events including non-compliances, exceeding usage limits, and other operational anomalies through the use of standard runbooks. Our approach provides real-time event detection with immediate automated response capabilities that minimize incident impact and reduce manual intervention requirements.

#### Event Detection and Classification

Our event detection framework monitors multiple AWS services and custom applications for operational anomalies, compliance violations, and performance degradations. CloudWatch alarms trigger on metric thresholds including CPU utilization, error rates, and custom business metrics, while AWS Config rules detect configuration drift and compliance violations in real-time.

Amazon GuardDuty findings automatically initiate security incident response workflows, and AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager events trigger compliance remediation. Custom application events integrate through Amazon EventBridge to enable business-specific incident detection and response capabilities.

Event classification categorizes incidents by severity, impact scope, and remediation complexity to route events to appropriate automated response workflows. The classification system considers business criticality, regulatory requirements, and operational impact to prioritize remediation efforts and escalation procedures.

#### Automated Runbook Framework

Standard runbooks define step-by-step remediation procedures for common operational scenarios including security incidents, capacity management, compliance violations, and performance degradations. Each runbook specifies trigger conditions, execution parameters, rollback procedures, and success criteria for automated validation.

Runbooks utilize AWS Systems Manager Automation documents for infrastructure remediation, AWS Lambda functions for custom business logic, and AWS Step Functions for complex multi-step workflows. The framework supports parameterized runbooks that adapt to specific incident contexts while maintaining consistent execution patterns and audit trails.

Version-controlled runbook management ensures consistent deployment across environments with automated testing and validation of remediation procedures. Runbook execution includes detailed logging, progress tracking, and automatic rollback capabilities for failed remediation attempts.

### Runbook Implementation Examples

#### Security Incident Response Runbook

**Trigger**: Amazon GuardDuty high-severity finding detected
**Automated Actions**:
1. Isolate affected EC2 instance by modifying security groups
2. Capture memory dump and disk snapshots for forensic analysis
3. Notify security team through SNS notifications
4. Generate incident report with detailed finding information
5. Initiate threat hunting workflow using AWS Lambda functions

**Implementation**: AWS Step Functions orchestrates the workflow with AWS Systems Manager Automation documents handling infrastructure changes and Lambda functions managing custom logic and notifications.

#### Compliance Remediation Runbook

**Trigger**: AWS Config rule violation for unencrypted S3 bucket
**Automated Actions**:
1. Enable default encryption on the non-compliant S3 bucket
2. Update bucket policy to deny unencrypted object uploads
3. Scan existing objects and encrypt unencrypted content
4. Generate compliance report and update CloudWatch dashboard
5. Notify compliance team through SNS of remediation completion

**Implementation**: Systems Manager Automation document executes S3 API calls with Lambda functions handling policy updates and reporting workflows.

#### Performance Scaling Runbook

**Trigger**: CloudWatch alarm for high CPU utilization exceeding 80% for 5 minutes
**Automated Actions**:
1. Trigger Auto Scaling Group scaling policy to add capacity
2. Monitor application performance metrics during scale-out
3. Validate successful scaling through health checks
4. Update monitoring thresholds based on new capacity
5. Generate capacity planning report for future optimization

**Implementation**: CloudWatch alarm triggers EventBridge rule that executes Step Functions workflow coordinating Auto Scaling actions with monitoring validation.

## Implementation Process

Automated remediation implementation begins with comprehensive runbook development and testing in non-production environments. Event source configuration establishes monitoring across all critical systems with appropriate threshold tuning to minimize false positives while ensuring comprehensive coverage.

Workflow deployment utilizes Infrastructure as Code principles with CloudFormation templates defining event processing pipelines and remediation workflows. Continuous testing validates runbook effectiveness with regular disaster recovery exercises and simulated incident scenarios.

## Success Metrics

Automated remediation effectiveness measures include mean time to remediation under 5 minutes for critical incidents, 95% automation rate for standard operational events, and 99% runbook execution success rate. System reliability maintains 99.9% availability for event processing pipelines with comprehensive audit trails for all automated actions and remediation outcomes.
