# Planning and Forecasting

## Overview

Effective planning and forecasting transforms AWS cost management from reactive reporting to strategic business optimization. ZirconTech provides comprehensive methodologies that enable highly accurate forecasting, total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis, and value realization measurement across the complete cloud adoption lifecycle.

Our approach encompasses discovery-based TCO analysis, pre and post-migration value quantification, pricing model optimization, bottoms-up forecasting for new workloads, and demand-driver based forecasting using unit economics and predictive modeling techniques.

## Comprehensive Planning and Forecasting Framework

**For detailed methodology, implementation procedures, and technical artifacts**: See [Planning, Forecasting & Total-Cost Analysis](planning-forecasting.md)

### Core Capabilities

#### Highly Accurate Forecasting and TCO Analysis

**Inventory-Based TCO Analysis**
- **IT Inventory Discovery**: CMDB integration, RVTools exports, and hardware/software inventory imports
- **Migration Evaluator Integration**: Automated lift-and-shift vs. right-sized workload modeling
- **Business Case Analysis**: OpEx/CapEx baseline comparison with quantified cloud value propositions

**Pre and Post-Migration Value Quantification**
- **Baseline Assessment**: Current state cost structure including support contracts and licensing
- **Value Tracking**: KPI dashboards measuring agility gains, MTTR improvements, and release velocity
- **ROI Validation**: Day 30, Day 90, and quarterly checkpoints comparing actual vs. forecasted outcomes

**Pricing Model Optimization**
- **Purchase Option Analysis**: On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instance modeling
- **Blended Optimization**: Mixed commitment strategies balancing flexibility and cost efficiency
- **EDP and Private Offer**: Enterprise discount program qualification and negotiation support

**Bottoms-Up Forecasting for New Workloads**
- **Infrastructure as Code Integration**: Terraform module resource counts feeding automated forecasting
- **Feature-Level Budgeting**: Per-feature monthly cost projections and tracking
- **Automated Budget Updates**: Daily dashboard refreshes with build-out vs. budget variance

**Demand Driver Based Forecasting**
- **Unit Economics Integration**: CUR data joined with business KPIs (MAU, transactions, storage)
- **Regression Modeling**: Historical data analysis creating cost-per-unit predictive models
- **Business Driver Projections**: Product roadmap integration for demand-based scaling forecasts

#### Value Realization Beyond Cost Savings

**Business Agility Metrics**
- **Developer Productivity**: Revenue-per-developer and release frequency improvements
- **Operational Excellence**: MTTR reduction and outage minutes tracking
- **Customer Experience**: Churn reduction and performance improvement correlation

**Revenue Attribution**
- **Feature-Level Tagging**: Resource costs correlated to specific revenue-generating features
- **Customer Profitability**: Per-customer cost allocation and lifetime value analysis
- **Market Expansion**: Geographic and product line cost efficiency tracking

#### Predictive Cost Estimates and Modeling

**Advanced Forecasting Techniques**
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Amazon Forecast with Prophet algorithm for 12-month projections
- **Linear Regression**: Historical trend analysis with confidence intervals
- **Scenario Modeling**: Low, medium, and high growth projections with variance analysis

**Time-Horizon Analysis**
- **Monthly Estimates**: Short-term operational budget planning and variance tracking
- **Quarterly Projections**: Business planning alignment with seasonal patterns
- **Annual Forecasts**: Strategic planning integration with Enterprise Discount Program commitments

#### Historical Cost Trend Analysis

**Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Analysis**
- **Comprehensive Data Pipeline**: Glue crawlers with partitioned CUR data and Athena views
- **Year-over-Year Comparisons**: Rolling 12-month spend analysis with trend identification
- **Seasonal Pattern Recognition**: Holiday, end-of-quarter, and business cycle impact analysis
