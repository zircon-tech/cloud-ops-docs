# Compliance and Auditing Overview

## Overview

The AWS Partner has methodology, process and relevant tooling experience to perform discovery of customer's compliance requirements and current posture, identify stakeholders with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and establish actions that need to be taken when required, along with periodic internal and external audit processes.

### 2. Auditing Process Description

#### Comprehensive Audit Framework

**Internal Audit Process**

Internal audits provide ongoing validation of compliance controls and operational effectiveness. The process begins with annual audit planning based on risk assessments and regulatory requirements. Quarterly internal audits focus on high-risk areas including access management, data protection, and incident response procedures.

Monthly operational audits validate control effectiveness through automated compliance monitoring and manual testing procedures. Weekly monitoring reviews ensure continuous compliance through automated alerting and dashboard monitoring of key compliance metrics.

**External Audit Process**

External audits demonstrate compliance to regulatory bodies and third-party assessors. Annual external audits are scheduled based on regulatory requirements including SOC 2, ISO 27001, and industry-specific frameworks. Semi-annual readiness assessments prepare for external audits through mock assessments and gap remediation.

External audit preparation includes evidence collection, stakeholder preparation, and audit scope definition. Audit execution involves auditor interviews, control testing, and evidence review. Post-audit activities include finding remediation, management response development, and continuous improvement implementation.

#### Audit Stakeholders and Responsibilities

**Internal Audit Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Audit Role | Frequency of Involvement |
|-------------|------------|-------------------------|
| **Internal Audit Team** | Audit planning, execution, reporting | Monthly operational audits, quarterly compliance audits |
| **IT Operations Team** | Control demonstration, evidence provision, issue remediation | Weekly for operational audits, monthly for compliance audits |
| **Security Team** | Security control validation, vulnerability assessment, incident analysis | Monthly security audits, quarterly risk assessments |
| **Compliance Team** | Regulatory requirement validation, policy compliance, audit coordination | Quarterly compliance audits, annual regulatory reviews |
| **Business Unit Leaders** | Business process validation, control effectiveness, business impact assessment | Semi-annual business audits, annual process reviews |

**External Audit Stakeholders**

#### Audit Documentation and Evidence Management

Audit evidence collection includes automated control testing results, manual procedure documentation, and stakeholder interview records. Evidence management ensures proper retention, access controls, and audit trail maintenance. Audit findings tracking includes remediation planning, implementation monitoring, and effectiveness validation.

Audit reporting provides executive summaries, detailed findings, and remediation recommendations. Stakeholder communication includes regular updates, milestone reporting, and completion certification. Continuous improvement incorporates audit lessons learned, process optimization, and control enhancement.

## Implementation Approach

Compliance and auditing implementation begins with stakeholder identification and role definition across AWS, Partner, and Customer organizations. Audit framework establishment includes process documentation, schedule development, and stakeholder training.

Operational procedures include audit planning, execution, and reporting processes with clear escalation paths and communication protocols. Success measurement includes audit completion rates, finding remediation timelines, and stakeholder satisfaction metrics.

## Success Metrics

Implementation effectiveness measures include 100% audit completion within scheduled timeframes, 95% finding remediation within agreed timelines, and comprehensive stakeholder participation. Compliance posture maintains certification requirements with zero critical findings and timely regulatory reporting.
