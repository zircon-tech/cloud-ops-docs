# Compliance and Auditing Overview

## Purpose

Systematic compliance and auditing overview ensures your AWS environment meets regulatory requirements while supporting business agility. Our methodology implements comprehensive controls and audit trails that demonstrate compliance across multiple frameworks.

## Methodology & Process

### Discovery and Assessment

We begin with comprehensive discovery to understand your current environment, identify requirements, and establish success criteria that align with business objectives.

### Design and Implementation

Our implementation approach prioritizes automation, consistency, and maintainability, using infrastructure-as-code and proven architectural patterns.

### Monitoring and Optimization

Continuous monitoring ensures implementations remain effective over time, with regular reviews and optimization recommendations.



## Technology Stack

| Layer | AWS Services | Alternative Options |
|-------|--------------|--------------------|

## 2. Compliance and Auditing Overview Methodology and Process

### Discovery Phase

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Collaborative workshops with technical teams, business stakeholders, and decision-makers to understand current state, requirements, and success criteria.

**Current State Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of existing compliance capabilities, identifying gaps, opportunities, and constraints.

**Requirements Analysis**: Documentation of functional and non-functional requirements aligned with business objectives and compliance needs.

### Design Phase

**Solution Architecture**: Design of target state architecture incorporating AWS best practices, security requirements, and scalability considerations.

**Implementation Planning**: Detailed project plan with phases, milestones, dependencies, and resource allocation.

**Risk Assessment**: Identification and mitigation strategies for technical, operational, and business risks.

### Implementation Phase

**Iterative Deployment**: Phased implementation approach with regular checkpoints and validation gates.

**Testing and Validation**: Comprehensive testing including functional, performance, security, and user acceptance testing.

**Documentation and Training**: Knowledge transfer through documentation, training sessions, and hands-on workshops.

### Operations Phase

**Monitoring and Support**: Ongoing monitoring, incident response, and continuous improvement processes.

**Optimization**: Regular reviews and optimization recommendations based on usage patterns and performance metrics.



## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| 1. Discovery | 1-2 weeks | Requirements gathering, current state assessment | Discovery document, requirements matrix |
| 2. Design | 2-3 weeks | Architecture design, tool selection, process definition | Design document, implementation plan |
| 3. Implementation | 3-6 weeks | Deployment, configuration, testing, validation | Working solution, documentation |
| 4. Knowledge Transfer | 1 week | Training, handover, ongoing support planning | Training materials, runbooks |

## Implementation Artifacts


## Compliance Implementation Runbook

### Step 1: Risk Assessment Framework

```yaml
# risk-assessment-template.yaml
risk_assessment:
  methodology: "NIST RMF"
  categories:
    - operational: "Infrastructure availability and reliability risks"
    - security: "Data breach and unauthorized access risks"  
    - compliance: "Regulatory non-compliance risks"
    - business: "Reputation and market response risks"
  
  assessment_matrix:
    impact_levels: ["Low", "Medium", "High", "Critical"]
    probability_levels: ["Rare", "Unlikely", "Possible", "Likely"]
    risk_scores:
      critical_likely: 20
      high_likely: 16
      medium_possible: 9
```

### Step 2: Audit Trail Configuration

```bash
# Enable comprehensive audit logging
aws cloudtrail create-trail \
    --name compliance-audit-trail \
    --s3-bucket-name compliance-audit-logs \
    --include-global-service-events \
    --is-multi-region-trail \
    --enable-log-file-validation

# Configure AWS Config for compliance monitoring
aws configservice put-configuration-recorder \
    --configuration-recorder name=compliance-recorder \
    --recording-group allSupported=true,includeGlobalResourceTypes=true
```

### Step 3: Data Classification Implementation

```python
# data-classification-scanner.py
import boto3
import json

def classify_s3_data():
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    macie = boto3.client('macie2')
    
    # Enable Macie for data discovery
    response = macie.enable_macie()
    
    # Create classification job
    job_response = macie.create_classification_job(
        jobType='ONE_TIME',
        name='data-classification-scan',
        s3JobDefinition={
            'bucketDefinitions': [
                {
                    'accountId': '123456789012',
                    'buckets': ['sensitive-data-bucket']
                }
            ]
        }
    )
    
    return job_response['jobId']
```


## Compliance Procedures and Checklists

### Incident Response Playbook

```markdown
## Security Incident Response Plan

### Phase 1: Detection and Analysis (0-30 minutes)
1. **Incident Identification**
   - [ ] Alert received via CloudWatch/Security Hub
   - [ ] Initial triage and severity assessment
   - [ ] Incident commander assignment

2. **Evidence Preservation**
   - [ ] Create EBS snapshots of affected instances
   - [ ] Capture VPC Flow Logs for investigation period
   - [ ] Export relevant CloudTrail logs to secure S3 bucket

### Phase 2: Containment (30-60 minutes)  
1. **Immediate Containment**
   - [ ] Isolate affected systems using Security Groups
   - [ ] Revoke compromised IAM credentials
   - [ ] Block malicious IP addresses via NACL

2. **Forensic Environment Setup**
   - [ ] Launch isolated forensic VPC
   - [ ] Deploy analysis tools (SANS SIFT, Volatility)
   - [ ] Mount evidence snapshots to forensic instances

### Phase 3: Investigation (1-24 hours)
1. **Evidence Analysis**
   - [ ] Memory dump analysis for malware/artifacts
   - [ ] Log correlation across CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, application logs
   - [ ] Timeline reconstruction of attacker activities

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - [ ] Determine scope of data exposure
   - [ ] Identify compromised systems and accounts
   - [ ] Assess regulatory notification requirements
```
