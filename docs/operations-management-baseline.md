# Operations Management Baseline

## Overview

The AWS Partner has methodology, process and relevant tooling experience to enable customers to define their overall infrastructure deployment strategy and develop instructions (runbooks) for handling operational tasks including patching, releases, handling vulnerabilities, change requests, application lifecycle, tagging, network management, and Identity and Access Management.

### 2. Infrastructure Deployment Strategy

We implement GitOps methodology where infrastructure and application changes flow through automated pipelines with built-in testing, security validation, and approval gates. We utilize AWS CodePipeline for orchestration, AWS CodeBuild for compilation and testing, and AWS CloudFormation or Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.

The strategy includes environment progression from development through production with automated testing at each stage. We implement blue-green deployments and canary releases for production changes, with automated rollback capabilities for failed deployments.

### 3. Operational Runbooks

#### Patching Operations

**Process:**
1. Review monthly patch releases and security advisories
2. Test patches in development environment using automated scripts
3. Schedule maintenance windows during low-traffic periods
4. Execute patches using Systems Manager Patch Manager
5. Validate system functionality post-patching
6. Update configuration management database with patch status

#### Release Management

**Process:**
1. Automated build and unit testing execution
2. Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
3. Deployment to staging environment with integration testing
4. Performance testing and load validation
5. Manual approval gate for production deployment
6. Blue-green deployment with health monitoring
7. Automated rollback triggers for failed deployments

#### Vulnerability Management

**Process:**
1. Automated vulnerability scanning using AWS Inspector
2. Risk assessment and prioritization based on CVSS scores
3. Automated patch deployment for known vulnerabilities
4. Manual remediation for complex security issues
5. Validation testing after vulnerability fixes
6. Compliance reporting and documentation updates

#### Change Request Management

**Process:**
1. Submit change request through automated systems
2. Impact assessment and risk evaluation
3. Approval workflow based on change complexity
4. Scheduled implementation during maintenance windows
5. Implementation validation and testing
6. Post-change review and documentation

#### Application Lifecycle Management

**Process:**
- Automated application deployment using ECS or EKS
- Rolling updates with zero-downtime deployment strategies
- Health monitoring and automated scaling based on demand
- Graceful application shutdown and retirement procedures

#### Tagging Strategy

**Process:**
- Mandatory tagging policies enforced through Service Control Policies
- Automated tag compliance monitoring using AWS Config
- Cost allocation and reporting based on standardized tags
- Regular tag auditing and cleanup processes

#### Network Management

**Process:**
- Automated VPC and subnet provisioning using infrastructure as code
- Security group rule management and validation
- Network ACL configuration and monitoring
- VPC Flow Logs analysis for security and performance optimization

#### Identity and Access Management

**Process:**
- Role-based access control with least privilege principles
- Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning
- Regular access reviews and permission auditing
- Multi-factor authentication enforcement
- Integration with Active Directory for centralized identity management
