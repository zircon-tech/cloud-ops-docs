# Third party products and procurement process

## Purpose

Effective third party products and procurement process requires systematic processes and automated controls that scale with your organization. Our approach implements preventive and detective controls that enforce compliance while enabling developer productivity.

## Methodology & Process

### Policy Development Methodology

**Compliance Mapping**: We begin by mapping your specific compliance requirements to AWS controls, creating a comprehensive matrix that links regulatory requirements to technical implementations.

**Control Design**: Each control is designed with both preventive and detective capabilities, using AWS-native services like Service Control Policies, AWS Config, and AWS Control Tower guardrails.

**Risk-Based Prioritization**: Controls are prioritized based on risk impact and implementation complexity, ensuring high-value protections are deployed first.

### Automated Enforcement

**Policy as Code**: All governance policies are defined in version-controlled code, enabling rigorous testing and change management processes that treat security controls with the same discipline as application code.

**Continuous Compliance**: Automated monitoring detects policy violations in real-time, with automatic remediation for low-risk violations and immediate alerting for high-risk scenarios.

### Evidence Artifacts Included

**Control Catalog**: Comprehensive library of preventive and detective controls with compliance mappings
**Policy Templates**: Service Control Policies (SCPs) and Config rules in JSON/YAML format
**Compliance Reports**: Sample control effectiveness reports and drift detection outputs
**Implementation Guides**: Step-by-step deployment procedures for each control type

## Technology Stack

| Layer | AWS Services | Alternative Options |
|-------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Core** | AWS Control Tower, AWS Organizations, AWS Config, Service Control Policies | |
| **Compliance** | AWS Security Hub, AWS Audit Manager, AWS CloudFormation Guard, AWS Systems Manager | |
| **Monitoring** | Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail Lake, Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Well-Architected Tool | |
| **Third-Party** | â€” | Terraform Sentinel (Policy as Code), Prisma Cloud (Compliance monitoring), Lacework (Cloud security) |


## 1. Third party products and procurement process Methodology and Process

### Discovery Phase

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Collaborative workshops with technical teams, business stakeholders, and decision-makers to understand current state, requirements, and success criteria.

**Current State Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of existing governance capabilities, identifying gaps, opportunities, and constraints.

**Requirements Analysis**: Documentation of functional and non-functional requirements aligned with business objectives and compliance needs.

### Design Phase

**Solution Architecture**: Design of target state architecture incorporating AWS best practices, security requirements, and scalability considerations.

**Implementation Planning**: Detailed project plan with phases, milestones, dependencies, and resource allocation.

**Risk Assessment**: Identification and mitigation strategies for technical, operational, and business risks.

### Implementation Phase

**Iterative Deployment**: Phased implementation approach with regular checkpoints and validation gates.

**Testing and Validation**: Comprehensive testing including functional, performance, security, and user acceptance testing.

**Documentation and Training**: Knowledge transfer through documentation, training sessions, and hands-on workshops.

### Operations Phase

**Monitoring and Support**: Ongoing monitoring, incident response, and continuous improvement processes.

**Optimization**: Regular reviews and optimization recommendations based on usage patterns and performance metrics.

## Implementation Artifacts


## Governance Controls Implementation Runbook

### Step 1: Deploy AWS Config Rules

```bash
# Enable AWS Config
aws configservice put-configuration-recorder \
    --configuration-recorder name=default,roleARN=arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/aws-service-role/config.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForConfig

# Deploy required S3 bucket encryption rule
aws configservice put-config-rule \
    --config-rule '{
        "ConfigRuleName": "s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only",
        "Source": {
            "Owner": "AWS",
            "SourceIdentifier": "S3_BUCKET_SSL_REQUESTS_ONLY"
        }
    }'
```

### Step 2: Security Hub Controls

```yaml
# security-hub-standards.yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  SecurityHub:
    Type: AWS::SecurityHub::Hub
    Properties:
      Tags:
        - Key: Purpose
          Value: CentralSecurityFindings

  CISStandard:
    Type: AWS::SecurityHub::StandardsSubscription
    Properties:
      StandardsArn: !Sub 'arn:aws:securityhub:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:standard/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/v/1.2.0'
    DependsOn: SecurityHub

  PCIStandard:
    Type: AWS::SecurityHub::StandardsSubscription  
    Properties:
      StandardsArn: !Sub 'arn:aws:securityhub:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:standard/pci-dss/v/3.2.1'
    DependsOn: SecurityHub
```
