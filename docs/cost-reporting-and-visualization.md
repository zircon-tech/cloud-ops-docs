# Cost Reporting and Visualization

## Overview

ZirconTech enables comprehensive cost reporting and visualization capabilities that transform AWS spending data into actionable business intelligence. Our methodology establishes complete visibility from single accounts to consolidated multi-account organizations through automated data processing, enforced tagging strategies, and real-time dashboard visualization.

## Core Capabilities

### Cost Measurement and Monitoring Strategy

Our approach centers on AWS Cost and Usage Reports delivered hourly to S3 with complete resource-level granularity. Automated Glue crawlers create Athena external tables enabling SQL-based analysis across all linked accounts within an AWS Organization. This foundation supports both reactive cost analysis and proactive optimization through anomaly detection and budget alerting.

### Account Structure Alignment

Cost allocation models align directly with organizational account structures using AWS Cost Categories and enforced tagging schemas. The LinkedAccountId column in CUR data enables seamless transitions from single account deployments to complex multi-account organizations without architectural changes. Monthly showback reports provide business units with detailed cost attribution and accountability metrics.

### Business-Relevant Tagging Schema

Mandatory tags including CostCenter, Project, and Environment are enforced through Tag Policies and Service Control Policies. A tag enrichment Lambda function automatically corrects missing tags at resource creation, while nightly Config rules audit compliance across the organization. This automation ensures consistent tag purity required for accurate cost allocation and showback reporting.

## Technology Implementation

### Data Pipeline Architecture

Cost and Usage Report data flows from S3 through Glue crawlers into partitioned Athena tables. Custom views including `vw_daily_cost` and `vw_ttm_cost` provide curated data access for business analysis. QuickSight dashboards connect directly to these views, enabling self-service cost analysis and executive reporting without manual data processing.

### Visualization and Reporting

Executive dashboards provide month-to-date spend tracking with variance analysis and forecasting. Cost center chargeback reports generate monthly CSV exports for finance systems integration. Unit economics dashboards join cost data with business KPIs to create metrics such as cost per 1,000 API calls or cost per customer transaction.

### Automation and Accountability

Daily cost ingestion occurs automatically through Lambda functions processing CUR files. Weekly variance reviews identify spending anomalies exceeding 5% variance, triggering automated ticket creation for investigation. Monthly chargeback processes generate business unit invoicing data through Athena query automation.

## Methodology and Process

### Discovery and Requirements Analysis
Stakeholder workshops with finance, DevOps, and business teams identify current cost allocation processes, shared service inventory, and business metric requirements for unit economics development.

### Foundation Implementation
Cost Explorer and CUR activation with hourly granularity provides the data foundation. Tag Policy implementation enforces standardized resource attribution. Cost Categories creation enables automated business logic for cost grouping and allocation rules.

### Dashboard Development
QuickSight dashboard creation includes executive summary views, business unit chargeback reports, and unit economics tracking. Athena view development provides curated data access optimized for common analysis patterns and automated reporting workflows.

### Operations and Continuous Improvement
Ongoing monitoring through cost anomaly detection and budget alerting ensures proactive cost management. Quarterly reviews of allocation rules and tag compliance drive continuous optimization of cost attribution accuracy and stakeholder adoption.
