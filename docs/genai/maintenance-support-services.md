**Example**: Escalation paths can include initial response from support engineers, technical escalation to AI/ML specialists for model-specific issues, and executive escalation for situations requiring business decisions or resource commitments.

## Response Times and Service Level Framework

### Issue Severity Classification

Issue severity determines response priorities and resolution expectations. Classification considers system impact, business criticality, and available workarounds.

**Severity Definitions**

**Critical Severity**: Complete service unavailability or critical functionality failure with no workaround, causing significant business impact or revenue loss. These situations require immediate response and resolution focus.

**High Severity**: Major functionality impairment or significant performance degradation affecting multiple users or key business processes, with limited or no workarounds. These issues warrant priority attention and expedited resolution.

**Medium Severity**: Moderate functionality issues or performance concerns affecting limited users or non-critical processes, with reasonable workarounds available. These issues receive timely attention within normal business operations.

**Low Severity**: Minor issues, general questions, or enhancement requests with minimal business impact. These matters are addressed through standard support workflows.

**Example**: A chatbot completely failing to respond would be critical severity, while slow response times affecting user experience would be high severity, occasional incorrect responses with human fallback available would be medium severity, and requests for additional features would be low severity.

### Service Level Targets

Response time expectations vary based on issue severity and engagement model. Specific SLAs are defined during contract negotiation based on customer requirements, application criticality, and support tier selection.

**Response Time Framework**

Critical issues typically receive initial response within hours, with continuous work toward resolution. High-priority issues receive same-business-day response with resolution focus based on complexity. Medium-priority issues receive response within business days with resolution timelines based on impact assessment. Low-priority issues are addressed during regular support cycles.

**Example**: For a mission-critical application, critical issues could target initial response within one hour with 24/7 availability, high-priority issues within four business hours, medium-priority within one business day, and low-priority within three business days. Specific commitments are established per engagement.

**Resolution Expectations**

Resolution timelines depend on issue complexity, system architecture, and required changes. Some issues can be resolved quickly through configuration adjustments or known solutions, while others may require code changes, model retraining, or infrastructure modifications requiring longer timeframes.

**Example**: Configuration issues might resolve within hours, while model performance problems requiring retraining could take days or weeks depending on data availability and validation requirements.

## Risk Management and Continuous Monitoring

### Workload Risk Assessment

Ongoing risk management identifies potential issues before they impact production operations. Regular assessments evaluate technical risks, operational dependencies, and business continuity considerations.

**Proactive Monitoring**

Continuous monitoring tracks system health, performance metrics, and usage patterns. Automated alerting identifies anomalies, performance degradation, or unusual behavior triggering proactive investigation before customer impact occurs.

**Example**: Monitoring systems can track model prediction quality, API response times, error rates, and resource utilization, with automated alerts for metrics exceeding thresholds or showing concerning trends.

**Periodic Risk Reviews**

Regular risk assessments evaluate system resilience, dependency health, and emerging threats. Reviews consider changes in usage patterns, data characteristics, or business requirements that might introduce new risks.

**Example**: Monthly operational reviews can assess recent incidents, performance trends, capacity adequacy, and upcoming changes that might affect system stability or performance.

### Change Management

Structured change management processes minimize risks associated with system updates, model retraining, or infrastructure modifications. Changes undergo appropriate testing, validation, and staged rollout procedures.

**Example**: Model updates can follow development, staging, and production progression with validation gates ensuring new versions meet quality standards before full deployment, with rollback procedures ready if issues emerge.
