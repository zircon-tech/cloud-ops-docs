# Distribute and Apply Patch Updates to Infrastructure Components

## Evidence Documentation

### 1. Standardized Image Creation, Scanning, and Patching Methodology

#### Standardized Image Creation Process

We can implement standardized image creation using AWS Image Builder to create and maintain golden AMIs. Our methodology includes base image selection from AWS-provided images (Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu, Windows Server), automated software installation and configuration, security hardening according to CIS benchmarks, and compliance validation before image publication.

The image pipeline includes automated testing before image approval and multi-region image distribution with version management.

#### Image Scanning Mechanisms

**Vulnerability Scanning Tools We Can Implement:**

For operating system vulnerabilities, we can implement Amazon Inspector and Qualys VMDR to scan for package vulnerabilities. Container image scanning can be performed using Amazon ECR Image Scanning and Twistlock for container vulnerabilities. Application-level vulnerabilities can be detected using OWASP ZAP and Veracode. Configuration compliance validation can be implemented through AWS Config and Chef InSpec. Network service vulnerabilities can be identified using Nessus and OpenVAS.

**Scanning Integration Approach:**
We can implement pre-build scanning to scan base images before customization, post-build scanning to scan golden images after hardening, runtime scanning for continuous scanning of deployed instances, and compliance scanning for CIS benchmark and regulatory compliance checks.

#### Image Patching Mechanisms

**Automated Patching Tools We Can Implement:**

For operating systems, we can implement AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager for OS-level patch management. Application components can be patched using AWS CodeDeploy and Ansible for application deployment and updates. Container images can be updated through AWS CodeBuild and Jenkins for container image rebuilding. Database systems can be patched using AWS RDS automated patching for database engine updates. Networking equipment can be updated through AWS Config remediation for network configuration updates.

**Patching Methodologies:**
We can implement immutable infrastructure approaches to replace entire instances with updated images, in-place patching to apply patches to running instances using Systems Manager, blue-green deployment to deploy patched images alongside current versions, and canary deployment for gradual rollout of patched images.

#### Infrastructure Component Patching Coverage

**Components We Can Patch:**

EC2 Instances can be patched using Systems Manager Patch Manager and golden AMI replacement through AWS Systems Manager and Image Builder. ECS Containers can be updated through container image rebuilding and redeployment using AWS CodeBuild, ECR, and ECS. RDS Databases can be patched through automated maintenance windows using AWS RDS automated patching. Lambda Functions can be updated through runtime updates and code deployment using AWS CodeDeploy and SAM. EKS Clusters can be updated through cluster version updates and node group replacement using AWS EKS and kubectl. Application Load Balancers, API Gateway, and CloudFront receive automatic AWS service updates through AWS managed updates.

#### Tools and Technologies

**AWS Native Tools:**
We can implement AWS Image Builder for automated image creation and testing, AWS Systems Manager for patch management and compliance, AWS Inspector for security assessment and vulnerability scanning, AWS Config for configuration compliance monitoring, AWS CodeBuild for automated build and testing, and AWS CodeDeploy for application deployment automation.

**Third-Party Tools We Can Integrate:**
We have experience integrating vulnerability scanners including Qualys, Rapid7, and Tenable. Configuration management can be implemented using Ansible, Chef, and Puppet. Container security can be enhanced using Twistlock and Aqua Security. Compliance tools including Chef InSpec and OpenSCAP can be integrated for compliance validation.

**Automation Frameworks:**
We can implement infrastructure as code using Terraform and CloudFormation, CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions, and orchestration using AWS Step Functions and Ansible Tower.

#### Exemptions and Special Considerations

**Exemption Categories:**

Legacy systems may require exemptions due to unsupported operating systems or applications, which can be managed through isolated network segments and compensating controls. Critical production systems with zero-downtime requirements may need extended testing periods and scheduled maintenance windows. Compliance requirements may restrict changes, requiring change control board approval and extended validation. Third-party dependencies with vendor-controlled update cycles may require vendor coordination and risk acceptance. Custom applications incompatible with standard patches may need application-specific testing and custom patch procedures.

**Exemption Management Process:**
We can implement risk assessment to evaluate security risk of delayed patching, implement compensating controls as additional security measures, maintain documentation for exemption justification and approval, establish regular review cycles for exemption validity, and create escalation paths requiring executive approval for high-risk exemptions.

**Special Handling Procedures:**
We can implement offline patch management processes for air-gapped systems, extended validation and approval cycles for regulatory environments, cross-platform patching coordination for multi-cloud environments, and on-premises and cloud patch synchronization for hybrid infrastructure.
