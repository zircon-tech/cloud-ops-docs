# Distribute and Apply Patch Updates to Infrastructure Components

## Evidence Documentation

### 1. Standardized Image Creation, Scanning, and Patching Methodology

#### Standardized Image Creation Process

**Golden Image Development Approach:**
We can implement standardized image creation using AWS Image Builder to create and maintain golden AMIs. Our methodology includes base image selection from AWS-provided images, automated software installation and configuration, security hardening according to CIS benchmarks, and compliance validation before image publication.

**Image Pipeline Components:**
- **Base Image Selection**: AWS-provided AMIs (Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu, Windows Server)
- **Software Installation**: Automated installation of required packages and applications
- **Security Hardening**: CIS benchmark compliance, security configurations
- **Validation Testing**: Automated testing before image approval
- **Distribution**: Multi-region image distribution and version management

#### Image Scanning Mechanisms

**Vulnerability Scanning Tools We Can Implement:**

| Scanner Type | Tool | Capability |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| **OS Vulnerability Scanning** | Amazon Inspector, Qualys VMDR | Operating system package vulnerabilities |
| **Container Image Scanning** | Amazon ECR Image Scanning, Twistlock | Container image vulnerabilities |
| **Application Scanning** | OWASP ZAP, Veracode | Application-level vulnerabilities |
| **Configuration Scanning** | AWS Config, Chef InSpec | Configuration compliance validation |
| **Network Scanning** | Nessus, OpenVAS | Network service vulnerabilities |

**Scanning Integration Approach:**
- **Pre-Build Scanning**: Scan base images before customization
- **Post-Build Scanning**: Scan golden images after hardening
- **Runtime Scanning**: Continuous scanning of deployed instances
- **Compliance Scanning**: CIS benchmark and regulatory compliance checks

#### Image Patching Mechanisms

**Automated Patching Tools We Can Implement:**

| Component Type | Patching Tool | Capability |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Operating Systems** | AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager | OS-level patch management |
| **Application Components** | AWS CodeDeploy, Ansible | Application deployment and updates |
| **Container Images** | AWS CodeBuild, Jenkins | Container image rebuilding |
| **Database Systems** | AWS RDS automated patching | Database engine updates |
| **Networking Equipment** | AWS Config remediation | Network configuration updates |

**Patching Methodologies:**
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Replace entire instances with updated images
- **In-Place Patching**: Apply patches to running instances using Systems Manager
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Deploy patched images alongside current versions
- **Canary Deployment**: Gradual rollout of patched images

#### Infrastructure Component Patching Coverage

**Components We Can Patch:**

| Infrastructure Component | Patching Approach | Tools |
|-------------------------|------------------|--------|
| **EC2 Instances** | Systems Manager Patch Manager, golden AMI replacement | AWS Systems Manager, Image Builder |
| **ECS Containers** | Container image rebuilding and redeployment | AWS CodeBuild, ECR, ECS |
| **RDS Databases** | Automated maintenance windows | AWS RDS automated patching |
| **Lambda Functions** | Runtime updates and code deployment | AWS CodeDeploy, SAM |
| **EKS Clusters** | Cluster version updates, node group replacement | AWS EKS, kubectl |
| **Application Load Balancers** | Automatic AWS service updates | AWS managed updates |
| **API Gateway** | Automatic AWS service updates | AWS managed updates |
| **CloudFront** | Automatic AWS service updates | AWS managed updates |

#### Tools and Technologies

**AWS Native Tools:**
- **AWS Image Builder**: Automated image creation and testing
- **AWS Systems Manager**: Patch management and compliance
- **AWS Inspector**: Security assessment and vulnerability scanning
- **AWS Config**: Configuration compliance monitoring
- **AWS CodeBuild**: Automated build and testing
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: Application deployment automation

**Third-Party Tools We Can Integrate:**
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Qualys, Rapid7, Tenable
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Chef, Puppet
- **Container Security**: Twistlock, Aqua Security
- **Compliance Tools**: Chef InSpec, OpenSCAP

**Automation Frameworks:**
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, CloudFormation
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions
- **Orchestration**: AWS Step Functions, Ansible Tower

#### Exemptions and Special Considerations

**Exemption Categories:**

| Exemption Type | Justification | Alternative Approach |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Legacy Systems** | Unsupported operating systems or applications | Isolated network segments, compensating controls |
| **Critical Production Systems** | Zero-downtime requirements | Extended testing periods, scheduled maintenance windows |
| **Compliance Requirements** | Regulatory restrictions on changes | Change control board approval, extended validation |
| **Third-Party Dependencies** | Vendor-controlled update cycles | Vendor coordination, risk acceptance |
| **Custom Applications** | Incompatible with standard patches | Application-specific testing, custom patch procedures |

**Exemption Management Process:**
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate security risk of delayed patching
- **Compensating Controls**: Implement additional security measures
- **Documentation**: Maintain exemption justification and approval
- **Review Cycle**: Regular review of exemption validity
- **Escalation Path**: Executive approval for high-risk exemptions

**Special Handling Procedures:**
- **Air-Gapped Systems**: Offline patch management processes
- **Regulatory Environments**: Extended validation and approval cycles
- **Multi-Cloud Environments**: Cross-platform patching coordination
- **Hybrid Infrastructure**: On-premises and cloud patch synchronization
