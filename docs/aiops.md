## 2. Use Cases and ML Models

### Infrastructure Monitoring
**ML Approach**: Time-series anomaly detection using statistical methods and seasonal trend analysis
**Implementation**: Amazon CloudWatch Anomaly Detection for CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics
**Capabilities**: We can implement threshold-based and pattern-based anomaly detection for infrastructure metrics

### Application Performance Monitoring
**ML Approach**: Performance baseline establishment and deviation detection
**Implementation**: Amazon DevOps Guru for application-specific performance anomaly detection
**Capabilities**: We can implement response time, throughput, and error rate anomaly detection for applications

### Security Event Analysis
**ML Approach**: Behavioral analysis and pattern recognition for security events
**Implementation**: Amazon GuardDuty integration with custom SageMaker models for advanced threat detection
**Capabilities**: We can implement anomaly detection for authentication patterns, network traffic, and resource access behaviors

### Cost Optimization
**ML Approach**: Usage pattern analysis and cost anomaly detection
**Implementation**: AWS Cost Anomaly Detection for spending pattern analysis
**Capabilities**: We can implement cost spike detection and resource utilization anomaly identification

### Log Analysis and Monitoring
**ML Approach**: Log pattern recognition and anomaly detection in textual data
**Implementation**: Amazon OpenSearch Service with anomaly detection plugins
**Capabilities**: We can implement error pattern detection, log volume anomaly detection, and custom log analysis

## 3. Automated Remediation Runbooks

### Infrastructure Remediation
**AWS Systems Manager Automation** provides the framework for automated remediation workflows. We can implement runbooks that:
- Automatically scale resources based on performance anomalies
- Restart services when application health anomalies are detected
- Modify security groups in response to security event anomalies
- Execute predefined remediation workflows through Systems Manager Run Command

### Application Remediation
**AWS Lambda Functions** serve as the execution engine for application-specific remediation. We can implement:
- Application service restart procedures
- Database connection pool resets
- Cache clearing operations
- Circuit breaker pattern implementations for downstream service issues

### Security Remediation
**Security Response Automation** using AWS services can be implemented to:
- Automatically isolate compromised instances using security group modifications
- Disable compromised user accounts through IAM policy changes
- Trigger AWS Inspector assessments for security anomalies
- Execute incident response workflows through AWS Step Functions

### Integration and Orchestration
**Remediation Workflow Orchestration** using AWS Step Functions enables:
- Multi-step remediation workflows with decision points
- Rollback capabilities for failed remediation attempts
- Human approval gates for high-risk remediation actions
- Integration with external ITSM systems for ticket creation and tracking

The remediation approach prioritizes automated response for well-defined anomaly patterns while maintaining human oversight for complex or high-risk scenarios through configurable approval workflows.
