# Identify, Quantify, and Manage Risks Relating to Technology and Business Needs

## Overview

The AWS Partner has methodology, process and relevant tooling experience to identify and quantify operational risks relating to infrastructure availability, reliability, security and performance, and business risks relating to reputation and ability to respond to changing market conditions. Our approach defines comprehensive mitigation strategies for any gaps identified through systematic risk assessment and management frameworks.

## Evidence Documentation

### 1. Risk Identification and Quantification Methodology

#### Operational Risk Assessment Framework

**Infrastructure Availability Risks**

Infrastructure availability risk identification begins with comprehensive dependency mapping across all AWS services, regions, and availability zones. Assessment includes single points of failure analysis, service quota limitations, and third-party dependency evaluation. Critical path analysis identifies services whose failure would result in complete system unavailability.

Quantification methodology utilizes historical availability metrics, Mean Time To Failure (MTTF), and Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) calculations. Risk scoring combines probability assessment based on historical incident rates with impact assessment based on revenue loss per hour of downtime. High-availability architecture gaps receive priority scoring based on potential customer impact and business continuity requirements.

**Infrastructure Reliability Risks**

Reliability risk assessment evaluates system resilience under varying load conditions, component failure scenarios, and degraded performance situations. Evaluation includes capacity planning analysis, auto-scaling effectiveness, and cascading failure potential across microservices architectures.

Risk quantification employs service level objective (SLO) deviation analysis, error budget consumption rates, and performance degradation impact assessment. Scoring methodology weighs probability of performance degradation against customer experience impact, measured through user satisfaction metrics and conversion rate analysis.

**Security Risk Assessment**

Security risk identification encompasses threat modeling, vulnerability assessment, and attack surface analysis across AWS infrastructure and applications. Assessment includes identity and access management gaps, data protection vulnerabilities, network security weaknesses, and compliance control deficiencies.

Quantification framework applies Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) ratings combined with asset value assessment and potential data exposure calculations. Risk scoring incorporates threat actor capability assessment, attack likelihood based on threat intelligence, and financial impact of potential security breaches including regulatory fines and reputation damage.

**Performance Risk Evaluation**

Performance risk assessment analyzes application response times, throughput capacity, resource utilization patterns, and scalability limitations. Evaluation includes database performance bottlenecks, network latency issues, and compute resource constraints under peak load conditions.

Risk quantification utilizes performance baseline deviation analysis, user experience impact scoring, and business transaction completion rate assessment. Scoring methodology combines probability of performance degradation with financial impact measured through transaction value loss and customer churn analysis.

#### Business Risk Assessment Framework

**Reputation Risk Analysis**

Reputation risk identification evaluates potential negative impacts to brand perception, customer trust, and market position resulting from technology failures or security incidents. Assessment includes social media sentiment analysis potential, customer communication gaps during incidents, and competitive disadvantage scenarios.

Quantification methodology combines incident frequency analysis with brand value impact assessment, measured through customer satisfaction scores, Net Promoter Score (NPS) changes, and social media sentiment analysis. Risk scoring weighs probability of reputation-damaging events against long-term customer lifetime value impact and market share implications.

**Market Responsiveness Risk Assessment**

Market responsiveness risk analysis evaluates technology infrastructure's ability to support rapid business model changes, new product launches, and competitive response capabilities. Assessment includes development and deployment pipeline limitations, scalability constraints for rapid growth, and technology debt that impedes innovation.

Risk quantification employs time-to-market delay analysis, competitive advantage erosion potential, and revenue opportunity loss calculations. Scoring methodology combines probability of market opportunity loss with financial impact measured through projected revenue loss and market share reduction over defined time periods.

#### Risk Quantification Matrix

**Probability Assessment Scale**

| Level | Description | Historical Frequency | Scoring Weight |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Rare (1)** | Unlikely to occur within 2 years | < 5% annual probability | 1x impact multiplier |
| **Unlikely (2)** | May occur within 1-2 years | 5-20% annual probability | 2x impact multiplier |
| **Possible (3)** | Likely to occur within 1 year | 20-50% annual probability | 3x impact multiplier |
| **Likely (4)** | Expected to occur within 6 months | 50-80% annual probability | 4x impact multiplier |
| **Almost Certain (5)** | Expected to occur within 3 months | > 80% annual probability | 5x impact multiplier |

**Impact Assessment Scale**

| Level | Operational Impact | Business Impact | Financial Impact | Scoring Weight |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Minimal (1)** | < 15 minutes downtime | Minimal customer impact | < $10,000 loss | 1x probability multiplier |
| **Minor (2)** | 15-60 minutes downtime | Limited customer complaints | $10,000-$50,000 loss | 2x probability multiplier |
| **Moderate (3)** | 1-4 hours downtime | Moderate customer impact | $50,000-$250,000 loss | 3x probability multiplier |
| **Major (4)** | 4-24 hours downtime | Significant customer impact | $250,000-$1M loss | 4x probability multiplier |
| **Critical (5)** | > 24 hours downtime | Severe customer impact | > $1M loss | 5x probability multiplier |

**Risk Scoring Calculation**

Risk Score = Probability (1-5) × Impact (1-5) × Business Context Multiplier

| Risk Score Range | Risk Level | Management Action Required |
|------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| **1-5** | Low Risk | Monitor and review quarterly |
| **6-10** | Medium Risk | Develop mitigation plan within 90 days |
| **11-15** | High Risk | Implement mitigation within 30 days |
| **16-20** | Very High Risk | Immediate mitigation required |
| **21-25** | Critical Risk | Emergency response and executive escalation |
