# GitOps Methodology for AWS Infrastructure

## Overview

GitOps represents a paradigm shift in how we manage cloud infrastructure—treating infrastructure as code with the same rigor and processes we apply to application development. Our methodology provides a repeatable workflow that empowers teams to define, test, and deploy AWS infrastructure through declarative code, continuous integration, and automated rollback capabilities.

This approach transforms infrastructure management from manual, error-prone processes into a reliable, auditable system where every change is versioned, reviewed, and automatically validated before deployment.

!!! tip "Why GitOps?"
    GitOps isn't just about automation—it's about creating a sustainable, scalable approach to infrastructure management that reduces risk while increasing deployment velocity.

## Discovery Phase: Understanding Your Infrastructure Landscape

The foundation of any successful GitOps implementation begins with comprehensive discovery. We start with collaborative workshops that bring together your key stakeholders—architects, security teams, and networking leads—to create a shared understanding of requirements and constraints.

### What We Gather

**Network Architecture Requirements**: Understanding your desired VPC layouts, CIDR ranges, and hybrid connectivity needs helps us design infrastructure modules that align with your networking strategy. This includes evaluating existing on-premises connections, planning for future growth, and ensuring compliance with network segmentation requirements.

**Compliance and Security Framework**: Every organization operates under different compliance requirements, whether PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, or industry-specific regulations. We map these requirements to specific AWS controls and ensure our GitOps pipeline includes automated compliance validation.

**Identity and Access Strategy**: Modern organizations require sophisticated identity management. We evaluate whether to leverage AWS IAM Identity Center, integrate with external identity providers, or implement a hybrid approach that meets your security and usability requirements.

**Operational Constraints**: Service quotas, regional requirements, and existing tooling preferences all influence our approach. Understanding these constraints upfront prevents costly redesigns later in the process.

### Deliverable: Requirements Matrix

All discovered requirements are consolidated into a living document stored directly in your GitOps repository at `/docs/requirements.md`. This ensures requirements remain accessible to your team and can evolve alongside your infrastructure.

## Tool Selection: Choosing the Right Foundation

Rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all approach, we select tools based on your team's expertise and organizational preferences. Our selection matrix considers technical requirements alongside team capabilities:

=== "AWS CloudFormation"

    **Best for**: Organizations preferring AWS-native solutions with built-in safety mechanisms
    
    CloudFormation provides excellent guardrails through AWS CloudFormation Guard tests and integrates seamlessly with AWS services. We implement comprehensive drift detection and automatic rollback capabilities that leverage CloudFormation's native stack management.

=== "AWS CDK"

    **Best for**: Teams with strong Python or TypeScript expertise who want familiar programming constructs
    
    The Cloud Development Kit allows infrastructure to be defined using familiar programming languages while still leveraging CloudFormation's reliability. We implement `cdk synth` and `cdk diff` operations in the CI pipeline to provide clear visibility into changes before deployment.

=== "HashiCorp Terraform"

    **Best for**: Multi-cloud environments or teams with existing Terraform expertise
    
    Terraform excels in heterogeneous cloud environments and provides excellent state management capabilities. Our pipeline integrates `tflint` for static analysis and `terraform plan` for change preview, ensuring all modifications are thoroughly validated.

=== "Pulumi"

    **Best for**: Teams preferring TypeScript/JavaScript with native language testing capabilities
    
    Pulumi enables infrastructure definition in familiar languages while providing robust testing frameworks. This approach allows teams to leverage existing unit testing knowledge for infrastructure validation.

## Repository Structure: Organizing for Scale

A well-organized repository structure is crucial for long-term maintainability. Our standard structure promotes reusability while maintaining clear separation between environments:

```text
infra/
├─ modules/          # Reusable infrastructure components
│  ├─ vpc/           # Virtual Private Cloud configurations
│  ├─ eks/           # Elastic Kubernetes Service setups  
│  ├─ rds/           # Relational Database Service patterns
│  └─ monitoring/    # CloudWatch and alerting configurations
├─ environments/     # Environment-specific configurations
│  ├─ development/   # Development environment
│  ├─ testing/       # Testing and staging environment
│  └─ production/    # Production environment
├─ pipelines/        # CI/CD pipeline definitions
│  ├─ github/        # GitHub Actions workflows
│  └─ codepipeline/  # AWS CodePipeline configurations
└─ policies/         # Security and compliance policies
   ├─ cfn-guard/     # CloudFormation Guard rules
   └─ opa/           # Open Policy Agent policies
```

### Branching Strategy

Our branching strategy balances safety with development velocity:

**Main Branch Protection**: The `main` branch represents your production environment and requires all changes to pass through our validation pipeline. Direct commits to main are prohibited—all changes must come through pull requests.

**Feature Development**: Developers work on `feature/*` branches for new infrastructure components and `env/*` branches for environment-specific changes. Each branch automatically triggers validation pipelines that provide immediate feedback.

**Deployment Flow**: Pull requests trigger comprehensive validation, including security scans, policy checks, and infrastructure planning. Only after code review approval and successful validation can changes merge to main, triggering production deployment.

## Continuous Integration: Automated Validation

Our CI pipeline implements multiple layers of validation to catch issues before they reach production infrastructure:

### Static Analysis and Security Scanning

Every code change undergoes rigorous static analysis using tools like `cfn-lint` for CloudFormation templates, `tflint` for Terraform configurations, and `cfn-nag` or `checkov` for security vulnerability detection. These tools identify potential issues ranging from syntax errors to security misconfigurations.

### Policy Validation

We implement policy-as-code using AWS CloudFormation Guard or Open Policy Agent (OPA) to ensure all infrastructure adheres to your organization's standards. These policies automatically verify requirements like mandatory encryption, proper tagging, and network security rules.

### Infrastructure Planning

Before any deployment, the pipeline generates detailed plans showing exactly what changes will be made to your infrastructure. For Terraform, this means `terraform plan` output; for CDK, it's `cdk diff` results. These plans are automatically posted to pull requests, enabling informed code review.

### Artifact Management

Successful validation results in validated infrastructure packages being stored in your artifact repository—either Amazon S3 or AWS CodeArtifact. This ensures only thoroughly tested configurations can be deployed to your environments.

## Continuous Deployment: Safe, Automated Releases

Our deployment pipeline prioritizes safety while enabling rapid iteration:

### Progressive Deployment Strategy

| Environment | Deployment Approach | Validation Level |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Development** | Automatic deployment with immediate rollback on failure | Basic functional testing |
| **Testing** | Manual approval gate with comprehensive testing | Full integration testing |
| **Production** | Blue/green or canary deployment where supported | Complete validation suite |

### Automated Monitoring and Drift Detection

Infrastructure drift—when actual infrastructure differs from its defined state—is a common challenge in cloud environments. Our methodology includes nightly drift detection using AWS Config, CloudFormation drift detection, or `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode` to identify and alert on any discrepancies.

### Rollback Capabilities

Every deployment includes automatic rollback capabilities. CloudFormation stacks can leverage built-in rollback features, while Terraform configurations maintain state history enabling quick reversion to previous known-good states.

## Identity and Access Management as Code

Security isn't an afterthought in our GitOps approach—it's integrated throughout the entire pipeline:

### Declarative IAM Management

All IAM roles, policies, and permission boundaries are defined in the same repository as your infrastructure, typically in an `infra/iam/` directory. This ensures security configurations are versioned, reviewed, and auditable.

### Federated Access Integration

We leverage AWS IAM Identity Center for centralized identity management, with all permission assignments managed through infrastructure as code. This approach eliminates manual access management while maintaining security.

### Continuous Security Validation

IAM policies undergo validation using AWS IAM Access Analyzer during the CI process, ensuring least-privilege principles are maintained and identifying overly permissive configurations before deployment.

## Monitoring and Alerting Integration

Effective GitOps requires comprehensive monitoring of both the pipeline itself and the infrastructure it manages:

### Pipeline Observability

All pipeline events integrate with your communication tools—Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email—providing real-time visibility into deployments, failures, and security alerts. Failed validations or detected drift automatically generate tickets in your project management system (Jira, ServiceNow, etc.).

### Compliance and Audit Trail

Every infrastructure change generates immutable audit trails through AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config, with all events forwarded to a central audit account. This provides complete visibility into who made changes, when they occurred, and what was modified.

## Implementation Deliverables

Your GitOps implementation includes comprehensive deliverables designed to ensure long-term success:

**Complete GitOps Repository**: A fully configured Git repository containing reusable infrastructure modules, comprehensive CI/CD pipelines, and automated guardrail validation rules.

**Operational Dashboards**: Direct access to deployment dashboards—whether GitHub Actions workflows or AWS CodePipeline consoles—providing real-time visibility into your infrastructure deployment status.

**Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed runbooks covering rollback procedures, drift remediation processes, and role escalation paths, ensuring your team can confidently operate and maintain the system.

**Knowledge Transfer**: Hands-on training sessions and recorded workshops that empower your team to extend and maintain the GitOps infrastructure independently.

This methodology transforms infrastructure management from a manual, error-prone process into a reliable, scalable system that grows with your organization's needs while maintaining the highest standards of security and compliance.
