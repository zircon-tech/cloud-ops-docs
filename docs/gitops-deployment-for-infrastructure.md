# GitOps Deployment for Infrastructure

## Overview

GitOps represents a paradigm shift in infrastructure management, treating infrastructure as code with the same rigor applied to application development. ZirconTech's GitOps methodology provides a declarative, version-controlled approach to AWS infrastructure deployment that enhances reliability, security, and operational efficiency.

Our approach transforms manual infrastructure processes into automated, auditable workflows where every change is versioned, reviewed, and validated before deployment through Git-based workflows and continuous integration pipelines.

## Comprehensive GitOps Framework

**For detailed methodology, implementation patterns, and technical procedures**: See [GitOps Methodology for AWS Infrastructure](gitops-methodology.md)

### Core Principles

- **Declarative Infrastructure**: All infrastructure defined as code in version-controlled repositories
- **Git as Single Source of Truth**: Infrastructure state and changes managed through Git workflows
- **Automated Validation**: Continuous integration with testing, security scanning, and policy compliance
- **Observable Deployments**: Comprehensive monitoring with automated rollback capabilities

### Key Capabilities

#### Infrastructure as Code Management
- **Multi-Framework Support**: CloudFormation, CDK, Terraform, and Pulumi integration
- **Repository Structure**: Organized modules promoting reusability and maintainability
- **Branching Strategy**: Safe development workflows with production protection

#### Continuous Integration Pipeline
- **Static Analysis**: Automated linting, security scanning, and policy validation
- **Testing Framework**: Infrastructure validation and compliance checking
- **Artifact Management**: Secure storage and versioning of deployment packages

#### Automated Deployment
- **Progressive Deployment**: Development → Testing → Production workflows
- **Drift Detection**: Automated monitoring for infrastructure configuration changes
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Automated reversion to previous known-good states

### Technology Foundation

| Component | Primary Services | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Source Control** | AWS CodeCommit, GitHub | Version control and change management |
| **Build & Test** | AWS CodeBuild, GitHub Actions | Automated validation and artifact creation |
| **Deployment** | AWS CodePipeline, CloudFormation | Orchestrated infrastructure deployment |
| **Monitoring** | AWS CloudWatch, AWS Config | Drift detection and compliance monitoring |
| **Security** | AWS CloudFormation Guard, Checkov | Policy validation and security scanning |

## Implementation Approach

### Discovery and Design
- Current infrastructure inventory and GitOps readiness assessment
- Repository structure design and branching strategy definition
- CI/CD pipeline architecture and integration planning
- Security and compliance policy framework establishment

### Pipeline Development
- Source control repository setup with organized module structure
- Continuous integration pipeline with validation and testing
- Multi-environment deployment orchestration
- Identity and access management as code implementation

### Operations Integration
- Monitoring and alerting configuration for deployment workflows
- Drift detection and compliance reporting automation
- Rollback procedures and emergency access protocols
- Team training and operational handover

## Deliverables and Evidence Artifacts

### Repository and Pipeline Artifacts
- **GitOps Repository**: Structured infrastructure code with reusable modules
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated validation, testing, and deployment workflows
- **Infrastructure Modules**: Reusable components for VPC, EKS, RDS, and monitoring
- **Policy Framework**: CloudFormation Guard rules and security policies

### Process Documentation
- **GitOps Workflow Guide**: Step-by-step procedures for infrastructure changes
- **Repository Standards**: Module organization and development guidelines
- **Deployment Runbooks**: Operational procedures for pipeline management
- **Emergency Procedures**: Rollback and incident response protocols

### Automation and Integration
- **Validation Pipeline**: Automated testing, linting, and security scanning
- **Deployment Automation**: Multi-environment orchestration with approval gates
- **Monitoring Integration**: CloudWatch dashboards and automated alerting
- **Identity Management**: IAM roles and policies defined as code

## Project Engagement

**For comprehensive project scope, timeline, and deliverables**: See [GitOps Infrastructure Deployment SOW](gitops-sow.md)

### Implementation Timeline
- **6-week delivery timeline** with milestone-based progress tracking
- **Weekly iterations** with continuous feedback and adjustment
- **Hands-on knowledge transfer** including pair programming sessions

### Success Criteria
- All infrastructure changes flow exclusively through pull requests
- CI pipeline prevents merge of changes failing validation or security checks
- Rollback capabilities accessible through pipeline UI without manual intervention
- Complete audit trail for all infrastructure modifications
