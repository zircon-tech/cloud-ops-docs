# Creating Cleanroom Environment for Forensic Analysis

## Overview

The AWS Partner has methodology, process and relevant tooling experience to enable customers to quickly react to identified security breaches including defining and implementing containment processes and procedures, establishing standard pre-configured forensic environments to analyze logs and tracing data, and determining compromises with evidential data support.

## Evidence Documentation

### 1. Methodologies for Creating Forensic Investigation Cleanrooms

#### Forensic Cleanroom Architecture

**Isolated Forensic Environment Design**

Forensic cleanroom methodology establishes completely isolated AWS environments designed specifically for security breach investigation and evidence analysis. The cleanroom architecture ensures forensic integrity through network isolation, controlled access, and comprehensive audit trails that maintain chain of custody for digital evidence.

Infrastructure design utilizes dedicated AWS accounts within AWS Organizations to ensure complete separation from production environments. VPC isolation includes custom route tables, network ACLs, and security groups configured to prevent any communication with production systems while enabling controlled internet access for forensic tool updates and threat intelligence feeds.

**Evidence Preservation Framework**

Evidence collection methodology ensures forensic integrity through automated snapshot creation, memory dump capture, and log preservation with cryptographic checksums. EBS snapshot procedures include metadata capture, encryption verification, and timestamp documentation to maintain legal admissibility of digital evidence.

Memory acquisition utilizes EC2 instance hibernation and custom AMI creation to preserve volatile memory state. Network traffic capture employs VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail API logs, and application-level logging to reconstruct attack timelines and identify compromise indicators.

**Forensic Tool Deployment**

Standard forensic toolkit deployment includes automated installation of industry-standard investigation tools through Systems Manager Automation documents. Tool suite includes SANS SIFT Workstation, Volatility Framework, Autopsy Digital Forensics Platform, and Wireshark for comprehensive evidence analysis.

Custom forensic AMIs maintain pre-configured investigation environments with validated tool chains, ensuring rapid deployment during incident response. AMI management includes regular updates, security patching, and tool version control to maintain forensic capability readiness.

#### Cleanroom Infrastructure Components

**Core AWS Services for Forensic Analysis**

| Service | Forensic Function | Configuration |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| **Dedicated AWS Account** | Complete isolation from production | Separate billing, IAM policies, network boundaries |
| **Forensic VPC** | Isolated network environment | No internet gateway, controlled NAT gateway, custom routing |
| **EC2 Forensic Instances** | Analysis workstations | Custom AMIs with forensic tools, isolated subnets |
| **EBS Encrypted Volumes** | Evidence storage | Customer-managed KMS keys, snapshot preservation |
| **S3 Forensic Buckets** | Log and evidence repository | Object lock enabled, access logging, encryption |
| **CloudTrail Forensic Trail** | Audit trail for investigation | Dedicated trail, tamper detection, encrypted logs |
| **Systems Manager** | Secure remote access | Session Manager for shell access, no SSH keys required |
| **AWS Secrets Manager** | Credential management | Forensic tool licenses, API keys, secure storage |

**Network Isolation and Security Controls**

Forensic network architecture implements complete isolation through dedicated VPC with no direct internet connectivity. Controlled internet access utilizes NAT gateway in separate subnet with egress-only rules for forensic tool updates and threat intelligence feeds.

Access controls implement least-privilege principles with dedicated IAM roles for forensic investigators. Multi-factor authentication requirements and session recording ensure accountability and audit compliance. Network monitoring through VPC Flow Logs provides visibility into all forensic environment activity.

**Evidence Chain of Custody**

Digital evidence handling procedures maintain chain of custody through automated metadata collection, cryptographic hashing, and timestamping. Evidence transfer protocols ensure secure movement of snapshots, memory dumps, and log files into forensic environment with integrity verification.

Documentation procedures include incident timeline creation, evidence inventory management, and investigation notes with tamper-evident storage. Integration with legal case management systems ensures proper evidence handling for potential litigation support.

#### Automated Cleanroom Deployment

**Infrastructure as Code Templates**

Forensic cleanroom deployment utilizes AWS CloudFormation templates for consistent and rapid environment provisioning. Templates include network isolation configuration, security controls implementation, and forensic tool deployment automation.

Deployment automation includes parameter customization for case-specific requirements, automated testing of forensic tool functionality, and verification of network isolation effectiveness. Template versioning ensures consistent deployment across multiple investigation scenarios.

**Rapid Response Procedures**

Automated deployment procedures enable forensic environment setup within 30 minutes of incident declaration. Automated workflows include evidence preservation, cleanroom provisioning, and forensic tool configuration with minimal manual intervention.

Integration with incident response procedures triggers automated cleanroom deployment based on incident severity and investigation requirements. Deployment monitoring ensures successful provisioning and validates forensic environment readiness.
