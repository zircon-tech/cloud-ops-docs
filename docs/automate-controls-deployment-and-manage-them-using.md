# Automate Controls Deployment and Management Using Code

## Overview

The AWS Partner has methodology, process and relevant tooling experience to enable customers to identify and react to infrastructure misconfigurations programmatically using proactive, preventive, and detective controls, while providing self-servicing capabilities for compliant configurations across the organization.

## Evidence Documentation

### 1. Controls Implementation and Central Management Through Code

#### Infrastructure as Code Framework

Our methodology enables centralized control management through AWS CloudFormation templates, AWS CDK constructs, and Terraform modules that codify compliance requirements as executable infrastructure definitions. We implement GitOps workflows where all compliance controls are versioned, reviewed, and deployed through automated CI/CD pipelines.

Our approach includes control definition repositories, automated testing frameworks, and deployment orchestration that ensures consistent application of compliance controls across all AWS accounts and regions. We deliver policy-as-code implementation that enables standardized control deployment while maintaining flexibility for environment-specific requirements.

#### Automated Control Deployment Pipeline

We implement control deployment using AWS CodePipeline with integrated compliance validation stages that execute pre-deployment testing, resource provisioning with embedded controls, and post-deployment verification. Our pipeline design includes infrastructure scanning, compliance validation, and automated rollback capabilities for failed deployments.

Our deployment automation includes AWS Config rule deployment, Service Control Policy management, and IAM policy distribution through AWS Organizations. We provide central logging and monitoring that delivers visibility into control deployment status, compliance drift detection, and remediation progress across the entire infrastructure estate.

#### Configuration Management and Drift Detection

We implement configuration management using AWS Systems Manager State Manager and AWS Config to maintain desired configuration states and detect configuration drift. Our automated remediation workflows trigger corrective actions when configuration deviations are detected, ensuring continuous compliance.

Our drift detection utilizes AWS Config rules, custom Lambda functions, and third-party tools to identify configuration changes that violate compliance requirements. We deliver automated remediation including configuration restoration, alert generation, and compliance reporting to maintain security and regulatory adherence.
