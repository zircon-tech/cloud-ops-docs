# Automate Controls Deployment and Management Using Code

## Evidence Documentation

### 1. Controls Implementation and Central Management Through Code

We implement centralized control management through AWS CloudFormation templates, AWS CDK constructs, and Terraform modules that codify compliance requirements as executable infrastructure definitions. All controls are version-controlled in Git repositories with automated CI/CD pipelines for deployment and testing.

Our control deployment utilizes AWS CodePipeline with integrated compliance validation stages, AWS Config rule deployment, and Service Control Policy management through AWS Organizations. We implement policy-as-code workflows that ensure consistent application of compliance controls across all AWS accounts and regions.

**Code Repository Structure:**
- Control definitions stored in version-controlled repositories
- Automated testing frameworks for control validation
- Deployment orchestration through AWS CodePipeline
- Integration with AWS Config, Security Hub, and Organizations

**Central Management Implementation:**
- AWS Config rules deployed as infrastructure code
- Service Control Policies managed through AWS Organizations
- IAM policies distributed centrally with automated updates
- Compliance validation integrated into deployment workflows
