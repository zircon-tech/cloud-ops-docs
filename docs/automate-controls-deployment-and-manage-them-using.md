# Automate Controls Deployment and Management Using Code

## Overview

The AWS Partner has methodology, process and relevant tooling experience to enable customers to identify and react to infrastructure misconfigurations programmatically using proactive, preventive, and detective controls, while providing self-servicing capabilities for compliant configurations across the organization.

## Evidence Documentation

### 1. Controls Implementation and Central Management Through Code

#### Infrastructure as Code Framework

Our methodology implements centralized control management through AWS CloudFormation templates, AWS CDK constructs, and Terraform modules that codify compliance requirements as executable infrastructure definitions. Control implementation utilizes GitOps workflows where all compliance controls are versioned, reviewed, and deployed through automated CI/CD pipelines.

Central management architecture includes control definition repositories, automated testing frameworks, and deployment orchestration that ensures consistent application of compliance controls across all AWS accounts and regions. Policy-as-code implementation enables standardized control deployment while maintaining flexibility for environment-specific requirements.

#### Automated Control Deployment Pipeline

Control deployment utilizes AWS CodePipeline with integrated compliance validation stages that execute pre-deployment testing, resource provisioning with embedded controls, and post-deployment verification. Pipeline stages include infrastructure scanning, compliance validation, and automated rollback capabilities for failed deployments.

Deployment automation includes AWS Config rule deployment, Service Control Policy management, and IAM policy distribution through AWS Organizations. Central logging and monitoring provide visibility into control deployment status, compliance drift detection, and remediation progress across the entire infrastructure estate.

#### Configuration Management and Drift Detection

Configuration management implements AWS Systems Manager State Manager and AWS Config to maintain desired configuration states and detect configuration drift. Automated remediation workflows trigger corrective actions when configuration deviations are detected, ensuring continuous compliance.

Drift detection utilizes AWS Config rules, custom Lambda functions, and third-party tools to identify configuration changes that violate compliance requirements. Automated remediation includes configuration restoration, alert generation, and compliance reporting to maintain security and regulatory adherence.
