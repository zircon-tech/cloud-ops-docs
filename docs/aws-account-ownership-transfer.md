# AWS Account Ownership Transfer

## Overview

AWS account ownership transfer is a critical process for organizations undergoing mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures. ZirconTech provides comprehensive methodologies and proven workflows that ensure secure, auditable transfer of AWS accounts while maintaining compliance and operational continuity.

Our approach addresses the complex technical, legal, and operational challenges involved in transferring account ownership, establishing new agreements, and updating organizational structures while minimizing disruption to business operations.

## Comprehensive Account Ownership Transfer Framework

**For detailed methodology, stakeholder roles, and technical procedures**: See [AWS Account Ownership-Transfer Methodology](account-ownership-transfer.md)

### Triggering Events

Account ownership transfers typically occur during:

- **Corporate mergers or acquisitions** where target accounts move under new parent organization
- **Divestitures or spin-offs** where subset of accounts leave the existing AWS Organization  
- **Changes to contractual obligations** including Enterprise Discount Program or Marketplace agreements

### Organizational Roles and Responsibilities

Successful account ownership transfer requires coordination across multiple stakeholder groups:

#### Executive Leadership
- **Executive Sponsor**: Provides final business approval and signs amended agreements
- **Legal/Procurement**: Reviews and executes Enterprise Agreements, EDP terms, and Marketplace agreements
- **Finance/Billing Owner**: Updates payer accounts, tax settings, and invoice reconciliation

#### Technical Teams  
- **Security Lead**: Validates guardrails, SCPs, and logging integrity before and after transfer
- **AWS Root Account Owner**: Updates root email, MFA, and contact information
- **AWS Partner Team**: Coordinates timeline, automates Control Tower/OU changes, liaises with AWS Support

#### AWS Resources
- **AWS Account Manager**: Processes new agreements and Enterprise Support mapping

### Transfer Process Framework

Our methodology follows a structured 7-phase approach:

1. **Discovery & Scoping**: Account inventory, compliance dependencies, and impact assessment
2. **Legal & Contract Updates**: Enterprise Agreement amendments and new EDP establishment
3. **Pre-Transfer Validation**: Security controls verification and audit trail preparation
4. **Technical Transfer**: Account detachment, root credential updates, and re-enrollment
5. **Billing Cut-Over**: Payer account changes and invoice reconciliation
6. **Post-Transfer Audit**: Compliance validation and control verification
7. **Documentation**: Process completion and health check scheduling
