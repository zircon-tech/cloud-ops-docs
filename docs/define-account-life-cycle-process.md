# Define Account Life Cycle Process

## Overview

Managing AWS account lifecycles effectively requires systematic processes, automation frameworks, and clear governance controls that scale across enterprise environments. ZirconTech provides comprehensive methodologies that automate account creation, suspension, and deletion while ensuring compliance and operational consistency.

Our approach leverages AWS Control Tower Account Factory and custom automation to deliver repeatable, auditable account lifecycle management that reduces operational overhead and maintains security standards throughout each account's journey.

## Comprehensive Account Lifecycle Framework

**For detailed methodology, automation workflows, and implementation procedures**: See [AWS Account Lifecycle Methodology](account-lifecycle.md)

### Lifecycle Stages

Our methodology covers the complete account journey through five distinct stages:

- **Request**: Business justification and approval workflow
- **Create**: Automated provisioning with baseline configurations  
- **Operate**: Normal operations with continuous governance
- **Suspend**: Temporary activity restriction with security controls
- **Delete**: Secure closure with compliance evidence retention

### Automation Capabilities

#### Account Factory Integration
- **AWS Control Tower Account Factory**: Native AWS automation for standardized account provisioning
- **Account Factory for Terraform (AFT)**: Infrastructure-as-code approach with enhanced customization
- **Custom Lambda Hooks**: Additional configurations during account creation lifecycle events

#### Automated Configuration Management
```bash
# Example post-creation automation
create-iam-role --role-name "ZirconTechOps"
enable-security-hub --standards "CIS-1.5" 
tag-resource --resource-id <accountId> --tags "CostCenter=1234"
```

#### Additional IAM Roles
Automatically created during account provisioning:
- **ZirconTechOps**: Break-glass administrative support
- **SecurityAudit**: Read-only security reviews and compliance
- **FinOpsReadOnly**: Cost monitoring and financial operations

### Technology Foundation

| Component | Primary Services | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Provisioning** | AWS Control Tower Account Factory, AFT | Automated account creation with baselines |
| **Governance** | AWS Organizations, Service Control Policies | Lifecycle state management and controls |
| **Identity** | AWS IAM Identity Center | Centralized access management and suspension |
| **Monitoring** | AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, AWS CloudWatch | Audit trails and compliance tracking |
| **Automation** | AWS Lambda, Amazon EventBridge | Lifecycle event processing and notifications |

## Implementation Approach

### Discovery and Design
- Current account inventory and governance assessment
- Business requirements for account classification and approval workflows
- Integration planning with existing ITSM and identity systems
- Compliance and retention requirement analysis

### Automation Deployment
- AWS Control Tower Account Factory configuration
- Custom IAM role templates and baseline policies
- Lifecycle event automation (Lambda functions, EventBridge rules)
- Integration with ticketing systems and approval workflows

### Process Integration
- Account request and approval workflow implementation
- Suspension and deletion procedures with security controls
- Drift detection and compliance monitoring setup
- Knowledge transfer and operational training

## Deliverables and Evidence Artifacts

### Process Documentation
- **Account Lifecycle Runbooks**: Step-by-step procedures for each lifecycle stage
- **Workflow Diagrams**: Visual representation of request-to-closure processes
- **Compliance Procedures**: Evidence collection and retention protocols
- **Escalation Procedures**: Break-glass access and emergency protocols

### Automation Artifacts
- **Account Factory Templates**: CloudFormation/Terraform configurations
- **IAM Role Definitions**: JSON templates for standard account roles
- **Lambda Functions**: Custom automation for lifecycle events
- **Integration Code**: ITSM and identity provider connections

### Governance Framework
- **Approval Workflows**: Documented business justification and sign-off processes
- **Suspension Criteria**: Clear triggers and procedures for account restriction
- **Deletion Policies**: Compliance-driven closure and evidence retention
- **Review Cadence**: Monthly drift detection, quarterly lifecycle reviews

## Success Criteria

- **Automated Account Creation**: Zero-touch provisioning through Account Factory
- **Consistent Baseline Configuration**: All accounts created with standard IAM roles and policies
- **Compliance Evidence**: Complete audit trail for account lifecycle events
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced manual effort and improved time-to-provision
