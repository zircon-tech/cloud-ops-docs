Session Management Mechanism Implementation","text":"<p>We can implement secure session management using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to establish browser-based or CLI-based secure shell sessions to EC2 instances without requiring SSH keys, bastion hosts, or open inbound ports.</p> <p>Session Management Implementation: We can configure AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to provide secure access to EC2 instances through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. Session Manager establishes secure sessions using TLS 1.2 encryption and routes traffic through AWS Systems Manager infrastructure.</p> <p>Session Logging and Auditing: We can implement comprehensive session logging by configuring Session Manager to log all session data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon S3 for long-term storage and audit compliance. Session logs capture all commands executed during sessions, including input and output, with timestamps and user identification.</p> <p>Access Control: We can implement access control using IAM policies that define which users can start sessions and which instances they can access. Access permissions can be scoped by instance tags, specific instance IDs, or resource groups to ensure least privilege access.</p> <p>Central Management: We can implement centralized session management through AWS Systems Manager console where administrators can view active sessions, terminate sessions if needed, and monitor session history across all instances. Session preferences can be configured centrally including session timeout, idle timeout, and shell preferences.</p> <p>Audit Trail: We can implement complete audit trails using AWS CloudTrail to log all Session Manager API calls, including session start and terminate events, user identity, source IP addresses, and session duration. Combined with session logs, this provides comprehensive audit capabilities for compliance requirements.</p> <p>This document provides evidence of our capability to implement secure, auditable session management for compute instances using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.</p>"},{"location":"cloud-operations/account-lifecycle/","title":"ZirconTech Methodology \u2013 AWS Account Lifecycle","text":""},{"location":"cloud-operations/account-lifecycle/#1-purpose","title":"1.

AWS Security Hub aggregates security findings from multiple security services and generates events for security violations. AWS GuardDuty generates threat detection events for malicious activity. Custom applications can generate events through CloudWatch custom metrics or direct EventBridge integration.</p> <p>Event Processing and Routing We can implement centralized event processing using Amazon EventBridge as the primary event router. EventBridge receives events from all sources and applies custom event rules to filter, transform, and route events to appropriate remediation targets. Event rules can include pattern matching based on event source, event type, severity levels, resource tags, or custom attributes. EventBridge provides built-in retry logic, dead letter queues for failed events, and event replay capabilities for troubleshooting.</p> <p>Automation Execution Engines We can implement automated remediation using multiple execution engines based on the complexity and type of remediation required. AWS Lambda functions provide serverless execution for simple remediation tasks, API calls, and custom logic. AWS Systems Manager Automation documents provide pre-built and custom runbooks for infrastructure remediation, patch management, and configuration changes. AWS Step Functions orchestrate complex workflows that require multiple steps, human approval, or coordination between multiple services. AWS CodePipeline can trigger deployment pipelines for infrastructure updates or application deployments as remediation actions.</p> <p>Runbook Implementation We can implement standardized runbooks using AWS Systems Manager Documents that define step-by-step remediation procedures. Runbooks can include AWS CLI commands, PowerShell scripts, Python scripts, and AWS API calls. Systems Manager provides pre-built runbooks for common scenarios including stopping non-compliant instances, applying security patches, updating security group rules, and rotating access keys. Custom runbooks can be developed for organization-specific remediation procedures and integrated with approval workflows for high-risk changes.</p>"},{"location":"cloud-operations/detect-and-auto-remediate-incidents-in-real-time-u/#typical-aws-services-used","title":"Typical AWS Services Used","text":"<p>Core Event-Driven Services Amazon EventBridge serves as the central event bus for routing and filtering events from multiple sources to appropriate remediation targets.
