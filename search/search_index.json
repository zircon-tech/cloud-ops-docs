Session Management Mechanism Implementation","text":"<p>We can implement secure session management using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to establish browser-based or CLI-based secure shell sessions to EC2 instances without requiring SSH keys, bastion hosts, or open inbound ports.</p> <p>Session Management Implementation: We can configure AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to provide secure access to EC2 instances through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. Session Manager establishes secure sessions using TLS 1.2 encryption and routes traffic through AWS Systems Manager infrastructure.</p> <p>Session Logging and Auditing: We can implement comprehensive session logging by configuring Session Manager to log all session data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon S3 for long-term storage and audit compliance. Session logs capture all commands executed during sessions, including input and output, with timestamps and user identification.</p> <p>Access Control: We can implement access control using IAM policies that define which users can start sessions and which instances they can access. Access permissions can be scoped by instance tags, specific instance IDs, or resource groups to ensure least privilege access.</p> <p>Central Management: We can implement centralized session management through AWS Systems Manager console where administrators can view active sessions, terminate sessions if needed, and monitor session history across all instances. Session preferences can be configured centrally including session timeout, idle timeout, and shell preferences.</p> <p>Audit Trail: We can implement complete audit trails using AWS CloudTrail to log all Session Manager API calls, including session start and terminate events, user identity, source IP addresses, and session duration. Combined with session logs, this provides comprehensive audit capabilities for compliance requirements.</p> <p>This document provides evidence of our capability to implement secure, auditable session management for compute instances using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.</p>"},{"location":"account-lifecycle/","title":"ZirconTech Methodology \u2013 AWS Account Lifecycle","text":""},{"location":"account-lifecycle/#1-purpose","title":"1.

AWS CloudWatch generates alarms based on metrics thresholds, custom metrics, and log pattern matching. AWS Config generates events when resources violate compliance rules or configuration changes occur. AWS Security Hub aggregates security findings from multiple security services and generates events for security violations. AWS GuardDuty generates threat detection events for malicious activity. Custom applications can generate events through CloudWatch custom metrics or direct EventBridge integration.</p> <p>Event Processing and Routing We can implement centralized event processing using Amazon EventBridge as the primary event router. EventBridge receives events from all sources and applies custom event rules to filter, transform, and route events to appropriate remediation targets. Event rules can include pattern matching based on event source, event type, severity levels, resource tags, or custom attributes. EventBridge provides built-in retry logic, dead letter queues for failed events, and event replay capabilities for troubleshooting.</p> <p>Automation Execution Engines We can implement automated remediation using multiple execution engines based on the complexity and type of remediation required. AWS Lambda functions provide serverless execution for simple remediation tasks, API calls, and custom logic. AWS Systems Manager Automation documents provide pre-built and custom runbooks for infrastructure remediation, patch management, and configuration changes. AWS Step Functions orchestrate complex workflows that require multiple steps, human approval, or coordination between multiple services. AWS CodePipeline can trigger deployment pipelines for infrastructure updates or application deployments as remediation actions.</p> <p>Runbook Implementation We can implement standardized runbooks using AWS Systems Manager Documents that define step-by-step remediation procedures. Runbooks can include AWS CLI commands, PowerShell scripts, Python scripts, and AWS API calls. Systems Manager provides pre-built runbooks for common scenarios including stopping non-compliant instances, applying security patches, updating security group rules, and rotating access keys. Custom runbooks can be developed for organization-specific remediation procedures and integrated with approval workflows for high-risk changes.</p>"},{"location":"detect-and-auto-remediate-incidents-in-real-time-u/#typical-aws-services-used","title":"Typical AWS Services Used","text":"<p>Core Event-Driven Services Amazon EventBridge serves as the central event bus for routing and filtering events from multiple sources to appropriate remediation targets.

Statistical anomaly detection algorithms identify unusual patterns automatically, while CloudWatch Insights provides SQL-like queries for log analysis and OpenSearch Dashboards enable interactive search across structured and unstructured data.</p> <p>Interactive Analytics</p> <p>Custom query builders provide user-friendly interfaces for complex data exploration, with saved searches serving as reusable templates for common investigations. Time-series analysis includes top contributors identification, trend detection with statistical forecasting, performance benchmarking against historical baselines, and predictive analysis for capacity planning.</p> <p>Dashboard Development Process</p> <p>Requirements gathering through stakeholder workshops identifies key metrics and visualization needs for different audiences. Template development creates reusable dashboard configurations with standard widget types and consistent visual patterns. Implementation uses Infrastructure as Code through CloudFormation or CDK for deployment, with dashboard configurations version-controlled in Git and automated testing for functionality validation.</p> <p>Alert Management</p> <p>Threshold configuration begins with statistical analysis to determine normal operating ranges, followed by dynamic thresholds using machine learning for adaptive alerting. Service quota monitoring provides proactive alerts before reaching AWS limits, while custom business metrics support customer-defined KPIs. Alert lifecycle management includes automated generation, tiered escalation based on severity, alert correlation to reduce noise, and automated closure with post-incident analysis.</p>"},{"location":"signal-analytics-and-visualization/#2-reference-dashboards-and-examples","title":"2. Reference Dashboards and Examples","text":"<p>Executive Business Dashboard</p> <p>This high-level dashboard provides business stakeholders with revenue per hour, active users, transaction volumes, and overall service availability. The visualization includes executive summary cards with trend indicators, revenue trend analysis, service health heatmaps, and geographic distribution of user activity. Key insights derived include business impact correlation with technical performance, cost optimization opportunities, regional performance variations, and security incident impact on operations.</p> <p>Operations Dashboard</p> <p>Real-time operational monitoring displays infrastructure metrics including CPU, memory, and disk utilization alongside application performance data such as response times and error rates. The service map visualization shows end-to-end distributed system health with live updating gauges for critical indicators. This dashboard enables performance bottleneck identification, service dependency impact analysis, incident correlation and pattern recognition, plus resource optimization recommendations.</p> <p>Developer Performance Dashboard</p> <p>Development teams access application-specific metrics including feature usage, API performance, and error patterns. Deployment health tracking shows build success rates and rollback frequency, while code quality metrics display test coverage and technical debt. The feature adoption funnel analyzes user interaction patterns, API performance matrices break down response times by endpoint, and error analysis provides frequency and impact assessment for optimization opportunities.</p> <p>Security Operations Dashboard</p> <p>Security monitoring consolidates login attempts, access patterns, vulnerability metrics, and compliance status. The threat intelligence feed correlates real-time security events while compliance scorecards track policy adherence trends. Geographic threat mapping shows attack sources and patterns, with incident response timelines tracking security event lifecycles. This enables threat pattern recognition, compliance gap identification, security posture improvements, and incident response effectiveness measurement.</p>"},{"location":"signal-analytics-and-visualization/#3-dashboard-security-access-control-policies","title":"3.
